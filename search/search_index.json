Continuous delivery is a method to develop software with short feedback cycles. It is applicable to projects both on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) and on SAP on-premise platforms. SAP implements tooling for continuous delivery in project \"Piper\". What you get \u00b6 To get started with project \"Piper\", you can choose from the following offerings: A set of predefined pipelines that build, test, and deploy your code changes You can choose between the following use cases: ABAP Environment Pipeline General Purpose Pipeline A shared library that contains reusable step implementations, which enable you to customize the preconfigured pipelines or to build your own ones, if necessary A standalone command line utility for Linux and a GitHub Action Note: This version is still in early development and might not contain all features of the Jenkins library, yet. Feel free to use it and provide feedback . A set of Docker images to easily set up a CI/CD environment using sophisticated life-cycle management To find out which offering is right for you, we recommend you to look at the preconfigured pipelines first. In most cases, you don't need to build your own pipelines - you can use the ready-made ones and adapt them according to your needs, if necessary. If you don't need to care about the underlying infrastructure of your pipelines, you can use the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service on SAP BTP. It offers an easy, UI-guided way to set up continuous integration and delivery without hosting your own Jenkins instance. The support infrastructure for SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery is provided by SAP according to the Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Project \"Piper\" offers community support using GitHub issues and pull requests. Users are free to contribute to the repository independently. See Contributing . For more information about the CI/CD solutions offered by SAP, see SAP Solutions for Continuous Integration and Delivery . To learn more about the continuous integration and delivery offerings by SAP, see Continuous Integration and Delivery by SAP and Continuous Integration and Delivery by SAP Learning Journey . The Best-Practice Way: Ready-Made Pipelines \u00b6 Use the general purpose pipeline to build a standalone SAP BTP application or an SAP Cloud Application Programming Model application project. It supports various technologies and programming languages. The Do-It-Yourself Way: Customized Pipelines \u00b6 The shared library contains building blocks for your own pipelines using Jenkins pipelines to implement best practice processes. For more information, see the Scenarios section from the navigation pane. The best practice pipelines are based on the general concepts of Pipelines as Code, as introduced in Jenkins 2 . This way, you can optimize your pipelines with the help of the Jenkins community. You can run the best practice Jenkins pipelines out-of-the-box, use them for project-specific adaptations, or create your own pipelines from scratch using the shared library. For an example, see the Build and Deploy SAPUI5 or SAP Fiori Applications on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) with Jenkins scenario. Extensibility \u00b6 For the vast majority of standard projects, the features of the ready-made pipelines should be enough to implement Continuous Delivery with little effort in a best-practice compliant way. If you require more flexibility, our documentation on Extensibility discusses available options. API \u00b6 All steps ( vars and resources directory) are intended to be used by Pipelines and are considered API. All the classes / groovy-scripts contained in the src folder are by default not part of the API and are subjected to change without prior notice. Types and methods annotated with @API are considered to be API, used e.g. from other shared libraries. Changes to those methods/types needs to be announced, discussed and agreed.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#project-piper-user-documentation","text":"Easily set up continuous delivery in your software development using SAP technologies.

Your configuration inherits from the default configuration located at https://github.com/SAP/jenkins-library/blob/master/resources/default_pipeline_environment.yml . Adding custom parameters Please note that adding custom parameters to the configuration is at your own risk. We may introduce new parameters at any time which may clash with your custom parameters. Configuration of the project \"Piper\" steps, as well as project \"Piper\" templates, can be done in a hierarchical manner. Directly passed step parameters will always take precedence over other configuration values and defaults Stage configuration parameters define a Jenkins pipeline stage-dependent set of parameters (e.g. deployment options for the Acceptance stage) Step configuration defines how steps behave in general (e.g. step cloudFoundryDeploy ) General configuration parameters define parameters which are available across step boundaries Custom default configuration provided by the user through a reference in the customDefaults parameter of the project configuration Default configuration comes with the project \"Piper\" library and is always available Collecting telemetry data \u00b6 To improve this Jenkins library, we are collecting telemetry data. Data is sent using com.sap.piper.pushToSWA Following data (non-personal) is collected for example: Hashed job url, e.g. 4944f745e03f5f79daf0001eec9276ce351d3035 hash calculation is done in your Jenkins server and no original values are transmitted Name of library step which has been executed, like e.g. artifactSetVersion Certain parameters of the executed steps, e.g. buildTool=maven We store the telemetry data for no longer than 6 months on premises of SAP SE. Disable collection of telemetry data If you do not want to send telemetry data you can easily deactivate this. This is done with either of the following two ways: General deactivation in your .pipeline/config.yml file by setting the configuration parameter general -> collectTelemetryData: false (default setting can be found in the library defaults ). Please note: this will only take effect in all steps if you run setupCommonPipelineEnvironment at the beginning of your pipeline Individual deactivation per step by passing the parameter collectTelemetryData: false , like e.g. setVersion script:this, collectTelemetryData: false Example configuration \u00b6 general : gitSshKeyCredentialsId : GitHub_Test_SSH steps : cloudFoundryDeploy : deployTool : 'cf_native' cloudFoundry : org : 'testOrg' space : 'testSpace' credentialsId : 'MY_CF_CREDENTIALSID_IN_JENKINS' newmanExecute : newmanCollection : 'myNewmanCollection.file' newmanEnvironment : 'myNewmanEnvironment' newmanGlobals : 'myNewmanGlobals' Sending log data to the SAP Alert Notification service for SAP BTP \u00b6 The SAP Alert Notification service for SAP BTP allows users to define certain delivery channels, for example, e-mail or triggering of HTTP requests, to receive notifications from pipeline events. If the alert notification service service-key is properly configured in \"Piper\", any \"Piper\" step implemented in golang will send log data to the alert notification service backend for log levels higher than warnings, i.e. warnings, error, fatal and panic. The SAP Alert Notification service event properties are defined depending on the log entry content as follows: eventType : the type of event type (defaults to 'Piper', but can be overwritten with the event template) eventTimestamp : the time of the log entry severity and category : the event severity and the event category depends on the log level: log level severity category info INFO NOTICE debug INFO NOTICE warn WARNING ALERT error ERROR EXCEPTION fatal FATAL EXCEPTION panic FATAL EXCEPTION subject : short description of the event (defaults to 'Step sends ', but can be overwritten with the event template) body : the log message priority : (optional) an integer number in the range [1:1000] (not set by \"Piper\", but can be set with the event template) tags : optional key-value pairs. The following are set by \"Piper\": ans:correlationId : a unique correlation ID of the pipeline run (defaults to the URL of that pipeline run, but can be overwritten with the event template) ans:sourceEventId : also set to the \"Piper\" correlation ID (can also be overwritten with the event template) cicd:stepName : the \"Piper\" step name cicd:logLevel : the \"Piper\" log level cicd:errorCategory : the \"Piper\" error category, if available resource : the following default properties are set by \"Piper\": resourceType : resource type identifier (defaults to 'Pipeline', but can be overwritten with the event template) resourceName : unique resource name (defaults to 'Pipeline', can be overwritten with the event template) resourceInstance : (optional) resource instance identifier (not set by \"Piper\", can be set with the event template) tags : optional key-value pairs. The following event properties cannot be set and are instead set by the SAP Alert Notification service: region , regionType , resource.globalAccount , resource.subAccount and resource.resourceGroup For more information and an example of the structure of an alert notification service event, see SAP Alert Notification Service Events in the SAP Help Portal. SAP Alert Notification service configuration \u00b6 There are two options that can be configured: the mandatory service-key and the optional event template. Service-Key \u00b6 The SAP Alert Notification service service-key needs to be present in the environment, where the \"Piper\" binary is run. See the Credential Management guide in the SAP Help Portal on how to retrieve an alert notification service service-key. The environment variable used is: PIPER_ansHookServiceKey . If Jenkins is used to run \"Piper\", you can use the Jenkins credential store to store the alert notification service service-key as a \"Secret Text\" credential. Provide the credential ID in a custom defaults file ( described below ) as follows: hooks : ans : serviceKeyCredentialsId : 'my_ANS_Service_Key' !!! warning It is not possible to configure the above in the project configuration file, i.e. in .pipeline/config.yaml Event template \u00b6 You can also create an event template in JSON format to overwrite or add event details to the default. To do this, provide the JSON string directly in the environment where the \"Piper\" binary is run. The environment variable used in this case is: PIPER_ansEventTemplate . For example in unix: export PIPER_ansEventTemplate = '{\"priority\": 999}' The event body, timestamp, severity and category cannot be set via the template. They are always set from the log entry. Collecting telemetry and logging data for Splunk \u00b6 Splunk gives the ability to analyze any kind of logging information and to visualize the retrieved information in dashboards. To do so, we support sending telemetry information as well as logging information in case of a failed step to a Splunk Http Event Collector (HEC) endpoint. The following data will be sent to the endpoint if activated: Hashed pipeline URL Hashed Build URL StageName StepName ExitCode Duration (of each step) ErrorCode ErrorCategory CorrelationID (not hashed) CommitHash (Head commit hash of current build.) Branch GitOwner GitRepository The information will be sent to the specified Splunk endpoint in the config file. By default, the Splunk mechanism is deactivated and gets only activated if you add the following to your config: general : gitSshKeyCredentialsId : GitHub_Test_SSH steps : cloudFoundryDeploy : deployTool : 'cf_native' cloudFoundry : org : 'testOrg' space : 'testSpace' credentialsId : 'MY_CF_CREDENTIALSID_IN_JENKINS' hooks : splunk : dsn : 'YOUR SPLUNK HEC ENDPOINT' token : 'YOURTOKEN' index : 'SPLUNK INDEX' sendLogs : true sendLogs is a boolean, if set to true, the Splunk hook will send the collected logs in case of a failure of the step. If no failure occurred, no logs will be sent. How does the sent data look alike \u00b6 In case of a failure, we send the collected messages in the field messages and the telemetry information in telemetry . By default, piper sends the log messages in batches. The default length for the messages is 1000 . As an example: If you encounter an error in a step that created 5k log messages, piper will send five messages containing the messages and the telemetry information. { \"messages\" : [ { \"time\" : \"2021-04-28T17:59:19.9376454Z\" , \"message\" : \"Project example pipeline exists...\" , \"data\" : { \"library\" : \"\" , \"stepName\" : \"checkmarxExecuteScan\" } } ], \"telemetry\" : { \"PipelineUrlHash\" : \"73ece565feca07fa34330c2430af2b9f01ba5903\" , \"BuildUrlHash\" : \"ec0aada9cc310547ca2938d450f4a4c789dea886\" , \"StageName\" : \"\" , \"StepName\" : \"checkmarxExecuteScan\" , \"ExitCode\" : \"1\" , \"Duration\" : \"52118\" , \"ErrorCode\" : \"1\" , \"ErrorCategory\" : \"undefined\" , \"CorrelationID\" : \"https://example-jaasinstance.corp/job/myApp/job/microservice1/job/master/10/\" , \"CommitHash\" : \"961ed5cd98fb1e37415a91b46a5b9bdcef81b002\" , \"Branch\" : \"master\" , \"GitOwner\" : \"piper\" , \"GitRepository\" : \"piper-splunk\" } } Access to the configuration from custom scripts \u00b6 Configuration is loaded into commonPipelineEnvironment during step setupCommonPipelineEnvironment . You can access the configuration values via commonPipelineEnvironment.configuration which will return you the complete configuration map. Thus following access is for example possible (accessing gitSshKeyCredentialsId from general section): commonPipelineEnvironment . configuration . general . gitSshKeyCredentialsId Access to configuration in custom library steps \u00b6 Within library steps the ConfigurationHelper object is used. You can see its usage in all the Piper steps, for example newmanExecute . Custom default configuration \u00b6 For projects that are composed of multiple repositories (microservices), it might be desired to provide custom default configurations. To do that, create a YAML file which is accessible from your CI/CD environment and configure it in your project configuration. For example, the custom default configuration can be stored in a GitHub repository and accessed via the \"raw\" URL: customDefaults : [ 'https://my.github.local/raw/someorg/custom-defaults/master/backend-service.yml' ] general : ... Note, the parameter customDefaults is required to be a list of strings and needs to be defined as a separate section of the project configuration. In addition, the item order in the list implies the precedence, i.e., the last item of the customDefaults list has the highest precedence. It is important to ensure that the HTTP response body is proper YAML, as the pipeline will attempt to parse it. Anonymous read access to the custom-defaults repository is required. The custom default configuration is merged with the project's .pipeline/config.yml . Note, the project's config takes precedence, so you can override the custom default configuration in your project's local configuration. This might be useful to provide a default value that needs to be changed only in some projects. An overview of the configuration hierarchy is given at the beginning of this page. If you have different types of projects, they might require different custom default configurations. For example, you might not require all projects to have a certain code check (like Whitesource, etc.) active. This can be achieved by having multiple YAML files in the custom-defaults repository. Configure the URL to the respective configuration file in the projects as described above.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"configuration/#configuration","text":"Configure your project through a yml-file, which is located at .pipeline/config.yml in the master branch of your source code repository.

The pipelines are centrally maintained and can be used with only a small amount of declarative configuration as documented here . For the vast majority of standard projects, the features of the ready-made pipelines should be enough to implement Continuous Delivery with little effort in a best-practice compliant way. If you miss a feature or discover a bug in one of our pipelines, please see if there is already an open issue in our GitHub repository and if not, open a new one. In some cases, it's not desirable to include specialized features in the ready-made pipelines. However, you can still benefit from their qualities, if you address your requirements through an extension . Extensions are custom bits of pipeline coding, which you can use to implement special requirements. This page explains extensibility options in project \"Piper\". For a high level overview of available options and how to interface with them, see this figure: Before building extensions, please make sure that there is no alternative that works better for you. Options for extensibility, in the order in which we recommend considering them: 1. Extend individual stages \u00b6 In this option, you use the centrally maintained pipeline but can change individual stages, if required. To do so, create a file called <StageName>.groovy (for example, Acceptance.groovy or lint.groovy ) in .pipeline/extensions/ in the source code repository of your application. For this, you need to know the technical identifiers for stage names. For the general purpose pipeline, you can find them in the pipeline source file . The centrally maintained pipeline checks if such a file exists and if it does, executes it. A parameter of type Map that contains the following keys is passed to the extension: script : Defines the global script environment of the Jenkinsfile run. This makes sure that the correct configuration environment can be passed to project \"Piper\" steps and allows access to the commonPipelineEnvironment , for example. When calling a piper step in an extension, the script object has to be passed using script: params.script . originalStage : Allows you to execute the \"original\" stage at any place in your script. If omitting a call to originalStage() , only your code is executed. stageName : Name of the current stage config : Configuration of the stage and general config (including all defaults) Here is a simple example for such an extension, which you can use as a starting point: void call ( Map params ) { //access stage name echo \"Start - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" //access config echo \"Current stage config: ${params.config}\" //execute original stage as defined in the template params . originalStage () //access overall pipeline script object echo \"Branch: ${params.script.commonPipelineEnvironment.gitBranch}\" echo \"End - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" } return this return this Don't forget the return this , which is required at the end of all extension scripts. This is due to how Groovy loads scripts internally. Init stage cannot be extended Please note that the Init stage also checks out your current repository including your extensions. Therefore, it is not possible to use extensions on this stage. Disable Extensions Execution By default, there is a possibility for extensions to get executed. In case of disabling it, please ensure to set PIPER_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS to true . Setting this parameter to true excludes the execution of extension files in .pipeline/extensions/<StageName>.groovy . Practical example \u00b6 For a more practical example, you can use extensions in the general purpose pipeline to add custom linters to your pipeline. A linter is a tool that can check the source code for certain stylistic criteria. Many teams choose to use a linter to ensure a common programming style. For example, if you want to use Checkstyle in your codebase, you might use an extension similar to this one in a file called .pipeline/extensions/Build.groovy in your project: def call ( Map parameters ) { parameters . originalStage () // Runs the build stage with built-in linters mavenExecute ( script: parameters . script , flags: [ '--batch-mode' ], pomPath: 'application/pom.xml' , m2Path: s4SdkGlobals . m2Directory , goals: [ 'checkstyle:checkstyle' ], ) recordIssues skipBlames: true , enabledForFailure: true , aggregatingResults: false , tool: checkStyle () } return this This code snippet has three components, let's see what is happening here: Firstly, we run the original stage. This builds the application and optionally runs ESLint on JavaScript/TypeScript source files and static checks using PMD and SpotBugs tools as these are standard features of General Purpose Pipeline. Secondly, we run the checkstyle maven plugin using the mavenExecute Jenkins library step as provided by project \"Piper\". This serves as an example for how flexible you can re-use what project \"Piper\" already provides in your extension. Finally, we use the Jenkins Warnings NG plugin and its step recordIssues to make the findings visible in the Jenkins user interface. This example can be adapted for other linters of your choice. Be sure to checkout the Library steps section of this documentation if you want to do this. Project \"Piper\" provides some basic building blocks such as dockerExecute and the already mentioned mavenExecute which might be helpful. 2. Modified Ready-Made Pipeline \u00b6 This option describes how you can copy and paste one of the centrally maintained pipelines to make changes to it that are not possible otherwise. For example, you can't change the order of stages and the stages that run in parallel or add new stages to a centrally maintained pipeline. A modified Ready-Made Pipeline allows you to modify your declarative pipeline based on the syntax Jenkins provides . This might be done for an individual project (in the Jenkinsfile ), or in a separate Git repository so it can be used for multiple projects. Single project \u00b6 The default Jenkinsfile of centrally maintained pipelines does nothing else but loading the pipeline and running it. This is convenient but limits the modifiable aspects of the pipeline. If one of your projects uses the pipeline, the easiest way to do this modification is to copy the pipeline into your Jenkinsfile . The basic structure of your Jenkinsfile should be the following: @Library ( /* Shared library definition, see below */ ) _ call script: this void call ( parameters ) { // Your pipeline code based on our ready-made pipelines } The actual pipeline code (the call method in the listing above) can be found here: General purpose pipeline Use the correct shared library definition Which shared library you need depends on the pipeline you're using. For the general purpose pipeline , you need 'piper-lib-os' . For the version identifier, please see the section How to stay up-to-date in this document. Multiple projects \u00b6 If you have multiple projects that share a similar architecture, it might be desirable to share one modified pipeline amongst them. Similar to what you can do in an individual Jenkinsfile , you can copy the pipeline to your own shared library and modify it. To do this, create a new Git repository in your preferred Git hosting service. It must be compliant to how Jenkins shared libraries are built . In a nutshell, this means that you need a vars directory inside which you can place a copy of your preferred pipeline. A minimal example of such a library could have the following directory structure: ./vars/myCustomPipeline.groovy ./README.md myCustomPipeline.groovy contains the modified pipeline code of the general purpose pipeline . Note The name of your custom pipeline must differ from the other pipelines provided by project \"Piper\" because Jenkins requires names across multiple libraries to be unique. This library must be placed in a Git repository, which is available for Jenkins and must be configured in Jenkins as documented here . The following screenshot shows an example of the configuration in Jenkins. Note that the name (1) must be the same as the one you use in your Jenkinsfile . The Jenkinsfile of your individual projects would look similar to the following: @Library ([ 'piper-lib-os' , 'my-own-pipeline' ]) _ myCustomPipeline script: this Be sure to adapt the names and version identifiers accordingly, as described in How to stay up-to-date . How to stay up-to-date \u00b6 Regardless of which of the above options you choose, one downside of this approach is that your pipeline will be out of sync with the centrally maintained pipelines at some point in time. We strongly recommend doing as little modification as possible to fulfil your requirements. Please be aware that stages may have dependencies on each other. Don't depend on stage implementation details Your pipeline should treat stages as a black box, the stage implementations are not a published API and may be subject to change at any time. Avoid accidental breaking changes By default, Jenkins uses the master branch of shared libraries. This way, you're always automatically using the latest and greatest version. The downside is that in rare cases, breaking changes might happen. Another potential issue is that your builds are not repeatable , that means building the same version of your application twice might have a different result. For those reasons, you might want to consider to fix versions to a released version like in this example: @Library('my-shared-library@v1.0') _ Find the most recent release for the jenkins-library on GitHub. To stay up to date with the latest releases, you can \"watch\" releases for those repositories on GitHub . When to go with a modified ready-made pipeline This option is right for you if none of the provided ready-made pipelines serves your purpose, and individual stage extensions don't provide enough flexibility. Advanced tips and information \u00b6 When you consider adding additional capabilities, your first stop should be the Jenkins Pipeline Steps Reference . Here you get an overview of what kind of capabilities are already available and a list of related parameters, which you can use to customize the existing implementation. The provided information should help you understand and extend the functionality of your pipeline. 3. New Pipeline from Scratch \u00b6 Since project \"Piper\" fully builds on Jenkins Pipelines as Code , you can also go with your own pipeline from scratch in a Jenkinsfile . Decoupling If you choose this option, you will be decoupled from the innovations provided with project \"Piper\", unless you re-use stages (as indicated above under 2. Modified ready-made pipelines ), for example. We recommend using this only when none of the other provided options suit your use case.","title":"Extensibility"},{"location":"extensibility/#extensibility","text":"When using one of the ready-made pipelines of project \"Piper\", you don't have to write custom pipeline code. The pipelines are centrally maintained and can be used with only a small amount of declarative configuration as documented here . For the vast majority of standard projects, the features of the ready-made pipelines should be enough to implement Continuous Delivery with little effort in a best-practice compliant way. If you miss a feature or discover a bug in one of our pipelines, please see if there is already an open issue in our GitHub repository and if not, open a new one. In some cases, it's not desirable to include specialized features in the ready-made pipelines. However, you can still benefit from their qualities, if you address your requirements through an extension . Extensions are custom bits of pipeline coding, which you can use to implement special requirements. This page explains extensibility options in project \"Piper\". For a high level overview of available options and how to interface with them, see this figure: Before building extensions, please make sure that there is no alternative that works better for you.

To do so, create a file called <StageName>.groovy (for example, Acceptance.groovy or lint.groovy ) in .pipeline/extensions/ in the source code repository of your application. For this, you need to know the technical identifiers for stage names. For the general purpose pipeline, you can find them in the pipeline source file . The centrally maintained pipeline checks if such a file exists and if it does, executes it. A parameter of type Map that contains the following keys is passed to the extension: script : Defines the global script environment of the Jenkinsfile run. This makes sure that the correct configuration environment can be passed to project \"Piper\" steps and allows access to the commonPipelineEnvironment , for example. When calling a piper step in an extension, the script object has to be passed using script: params.script . originalStage : Allows you to execute the \"original\" stage at any place in your script. If omitting a call to originalStage() , only your code is executed. stageName : Name of the current stage config : Configuration of the stage and general config (including all defaults) Here is a simple example for such an extension, which you can use as a starting point: void call ( Map params ) { //access stage name echo \"Start - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" //access config echo \"Current stage config: ${params.config}\" //execute original stage as defined in the template params . originalStage () //access overall pipeline script object echo \"Branch: ${params.script.commonPipelineEnvironment.gitBranch}\" echo \"End - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" } return this return this Don't forget the return this , which is required at the end of all extension scripts.

Extend the Docker call in the following way: docker run ... -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ... Plugins \u00b6 Project \"Piper\" requires a set of plugins installed on your Jenkins server. This set may evolve in the future. Make sure that all plugins of the appropriate versions are installed. Shared Library \u00b6 Shared libraries extending the Jenkins pipeline are defined within the Jenkins system configuration. A library is defined by a link to its source repository and an appropriate version identifier. To add the project \"Piper\"s library, execute the following steps: Open the Jenkins UI under http://<jenkins-server-address>:<http-port> , login with administration privileges, and choose Manage Jenkins > Configure System . Scroll down to section Global Pipeline Libraries and choose the Add button. A new library is created. For Library Name , enter piper-lib-os . For Default Version , enter the branch or tag you want to consume (e.g. master or v0.1 ). For Retrieval Method , choose Modern SCM . For Source Code Management , choose Git . For Project Repository , enter the GitHub URL of the project Piper shared library https://github.com/SAP/jenkins-library . Save your changes. Result: The library is available as piper-lib-os . To use it by any pipeline, add the following line to its Jenkinsfile : @Library ( 'piper-lib-os' ) _ When the pipeline is launched, Jenkins downloads the corresponding library as source and compiles it before the pipeline is processed. User Permission Issue \u00b6 Your native Jenkins installation defines the user jenkins as a service user. If it doesn't exist, it is created. In this case, the user ID is the next free number determined by /etc/passwd - probably starting from 100 . In contrast, the official Jenkins Docker image defines the user jenkins with the user ID 1000 as a service user inside the container. So, the service user ID of your native Jenkins server most likely differs from the user ID of the official Jenkins Docker image. This could have impacts. Project \"Piper\" runs many pipeline steps as Docker images. If a Docker container is created, the Jenkins Docker plugin passes the Jenkins user and group ID as a process owner into the Docker container. Binding a folder from the host machine into the container - used to exchange files between steps - results in file permission issues, if the user inside the container doesn't have rights for the folder on the host machine or vice versa. Although you won't face this issue with images of project \"Piper\" , some 3rd-party Docker images follow this convention and expect to be executed under userid 1000 , like node.js , which is used by a set of additional steps. If you face such a user permission issue , choose between the following options: Change the ID of your Jenkins service user to 1000 . Create your own images and solve the permission issues by removing the file system restrictions. Adjust the configuration accordingly, for example, adjust the npmExecute step of your project's YAML: npmExecute: dockerImage: 'my-node:8-stretch' Set up a namespace.

Currently, Vault's key value engine is supported in version 1 and 2, although we recommend version 2 since it supports the versioning of secrets Parameters that support being fetched from Vault are marked with the Vault Label in the Step Documentation. Authenticating Piper to Vault \u00b6 Piper currently supports Vault's AppRole and Token authentication. However, AppRole authentication is recommended since Piper is able to regularly rotate the SecretID, which is not possible with a Token. AppRole Authentication \u00b6 To authenticate against Vault, using AppRole authentication you need to do the following things Enable AppRole authentication in your Vault instance. After that you have to create an AppRole Role for Piper Assign the necessary policies to your newly created AppRole. Take the AppRole ID and create a Jenkins Secret Text credential. Take the AppRole Secret ID and create a Jenkins Secret Text credential. Token Authentication \u00b6 First step to use Token authentication is to Create a Vault Token In order to use a Vault token for authentication you need to store the Vault token inside your Jenkins instance as shown below. Setup a Secret Store in Vault \u00b6 The first step to store your pipeline secrets in Vault, is to enable a the Key-Value Engine . Then create a policy which grants read access to the key value engine. Pipeline Configuration \u00b6 For pipelines to actually use the secrets stored in Vault you need to adjust your config.yml : general: ... vaultServerUrl: '<YOUR_VAULT_SERVER_URL>' vaultNamespace: '<YOUR_NAMESPACE_NAME>' # if you are not using vault's namespace feature you can remove this line vaultPath: 'kv/my-pipeline' # the path under which your jenkins secrets are stored ... To authenticate you need to provide PIPER_vaultAppRoleID and PIPER_vaultAppRoleSecretID if you use app role authentication or PIPER_vaultToken if you use token authentication. Jenkins When running a step via the Jenkins library you can use Jenkins credentials for pass this values. Use vaultAppRoleTokenCredentialsId and vaultAppRoleSecretTokenCredentialsId or vaultTokenCredentialsId in your config.yml . Configuring the Secret Lookup \u00b6 When Piper is configured to lookup secrets in Vault, there are some aspects that need to be considered. Overwriting of Parameters \u00b6 Whenever a parameter is provided via config.yml or passed to the CLI it gets overwritten when a secret is found in Vault. To disable overriding parameters put a vaultDisableOverwrite: true on Step Stage or General Section in your config. general : ... vaultDisableOverwrite : true ... steps : executeBuild : vaultDisableOverwrite : false ... Skipping Vault Secret Lookup \u00b6 It is also possible to skip Vault for Steps , Stages or in General by using the skipVault config parameter as shown below. ... steps : executeBuild : skipVault : true # Skip Vault Secret Lookup for this step Using Vault for general purpose and test credentials \u00b6 Vault can be used with piper to fetch any credentials, e.g. when they need to be appended to custom piper extensions or when they need to be appended to test command. The configuration for Vault general purpose credentials can be added to any piper golang-based step. The configuration has to be done as follows: general : < your Vault configuration > # see above ... steps : < piper go step > : vaultCredentialPath : 'myStepCredentials' vaultCredentialKeys : [ 'myAppId' , 'myAppSecret' ] In case if you want to retrieve secrets from multiple vault folders, pass several paths with keys: general : < your Vault configuration > # see above ... steps : < piper go step > : vaultCredentialPath : [ 'myStepCredentials1' , 'myStepCredentials2' ] vaultCredentialKeys : [[ 'myAppId1' , 'myAppSecret1' ], [ 'myAppId2' , 'myAppSecret2' ]] The vaultCredentialPath parameter is the endpoint of your credential path in Vault. Depending on your general config, the lookup for the credential IDs will be done in the following order respectively locations. The first path with found general purpose credentials will be used. <vaultPath>/<vaultCredentialPath> <vaultBasePath>/<vaultPipelineName>/<vaultCredentialPath> <vaultBasePath>/GROUP-SECRETS/<vaultCredentialPath> The vaultCredentialKeys parameter is a list of credential IDs. The secret value of the credential will be exposed as an environment variable prefixed by \"PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_\" and transformed to a valid variable name. For a credential ID named myAppId the forwarded environment variable to the step will be PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_MYAPPID containing the secret. The Base64 encoded secret value will be exposed as environment variable to the step as PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_MYAPPID_BASE64 . Hyphens will be replaced by underscores and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed. Using a custom prefix for credentials By default the prefix for credentials is PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_ . It is possible to use a custom prefix by setting for example vaultCredentialEnvPrefix: MY_CUSTOM_PREFIX in your configuration. With this above credential ID named myAppId will be populated into an environment variable with the name MY_CUSTOM_PREFIX_MYAPPID . In case you want to use specific prefix for secrets retrieved from different vault folders, pass multiple prefixes as vaultCredentialEnvPrefix: ['MY_CUSTOM_PREFIX_1', 'MY_CUSTOM_PREFIX_2'] . With this above credential ID named myAppId1 will be populated into an environment variable with the name MY_CUSTOM_PREFIX_1_MYAPPID1 and myAppId2 will be populated into an environment variable with name MY_CUSTOM_PREFIX_2_MYAPPID2 Extended logging for Vault secret fetching (e.g. found credentials and environment variable names) can be activated via verbose: true configuration.

The configuration for Vault test credentials can be added to any piper golang-based step. The configuration has to be done as follows: general : < your Vault configuration > # see above ... steps : < piper go step > : vaultTestCredentialPath : 'myTestStepCrecetials' vaultTestCredentialKeys : [ 'myAppId' , 'myAppSecret' ] The vaultTestCredentialPath parameter is the endpoint of your credential path in vault.

The idea is that only configured stages are executed and the user is able to choose the appropriate stages. In this section, you can learn how to create a configuration in a (GitHub) repository to run an ABAP environment pipeline used for testing. This specific example will create a pipeline, which executes ATC checks after creating a new ABAP environment system. In the end, the system will be deprovisioned. You can have a look at different pipeline configurations in our SAP-samples repository or learn more about the configuration in the respective stage or step documentation.

Prerequisites \u00b6 Configure your Jenkins server according to the documentation . Create a git repository on a host reachable by the Jenkins server (e.g. GitHub.com). The pipeline will be configured in this repository. Create a GitHub user with read access. The entitlements for the ABAP environment system are available in the SAP BTP global account and assigned to the subaccount. A Cloud Foundry organization & space with the allocated entitlements are available. A Cloud Foundry user & password with the required authorization (\"Space Developer\") in the organization and space are available. User and password were saved in the Jenkins Credentials Store. 2. Jenkinsfile \u00b6 Create a file named Jenkinsfile in your repository with the following content: @Library('piper-lib-os') _ abapEnvironmentPipeline script: this The annotation @Library('piper-lib-os') is a reference to the Jenkins Configuration, where you configured the project \"Piper\" library as a \"Global Pipeline Library\". If you want to avoid breaking changes we advise you to use a specific release of the Piper Library instead of the default master branch. This can be achieved by either adapting the configuration (see documentation ) or by specifying the release within the annotaion: @Library('piper-lib-os@v1.53.0') _ An Overview of the releases of the project \"Piper\" library can be found here . 3. Configuration for Cloning the repositories \u00b6 If you have specified the Clone Repositories stage you can make use of a dedicated configuration file containing the repositories to be pulled and the branches to be switched on. The repositories flag makes use of such a configuration file and helps executing a Pull , Clone and Checkout of the branches of the repositores. Create the file repositories.yml with the following structure containing your repositories including the branches for this stage. repositories: - name: '/DMO/GIT_REPOSITORY' branch: 'master' - name: '/DMO/GIT_REPO' branch: 'master' You can later use the repositories.yml file for the repositories parameter in the Clone Repositories stage used in chapter 5. Technical Pipeline Configuration . 4. Optional: Configuration for the ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC) and ABAP Unit Tests (AUnit) \u00b6 As a default, a configuration for ATC and AUnit is generated out of the repositories.yml file. This default configuration checks the listed repositories using the default ATC check variant and with no AUnit restrictions regarding duration and risk level . If you want to configure these tools yourself, you can create a tool specific configuration. ATC \u00b6 Create a file atcConfig.yml to store the configuration for the ATC run. In this file, you can specify which packages or software components shall be checked. Please have a look at the step documentation for more details. You have to pass the filename atcConfig.yml to the atcConfig parameter in the 5. Technical Pipeline Configuration . Here is an example of the configuration: objectSet: softwarecomponent: - name: \"/DMO/REPO\" AUnit \u00b6 Create a file aunitConfig.yml to store the configuration for the AUnit run. In this file, you can specify which packages or software components shall be checked. Please have a look at the step documentation for more details. You have to pass the filename aunitConfig.yml to the aunitConfig parameter in the 5. Technical Pipeline Configuration . Here is an example of the configuration: title: My AUnit run objectSet: softwarecomponents: - name: Z_TEST_SC - name: Z_TEST_SC2 5. Technical Pipeline Configuration \u00b6 Create a file .pipeline/config.yml where you store the configuration for the pipeline, e.g. apiEndpoints and credentialIds. The steps make use of the credentials store of the Jenkins server. Here is an example of the configuration file: general: cfApiEndpoint: 'https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com' cfOrg: 'your-cf-org' cfSpace: 'yourSpace' cfCredentialsId: 'cfAuthentification' cfServiceInstance: 'abapEnvironmentPipeline' stages: Prepare System: cfService: 'abap' cfServicePlan: 'standard' abapSystemAdminEmail: 'user@example.com' abapSystemDescription: 'ABAP Environment Q System' abapSystemIsDevelopmentAllowed: false abapSystemID: 'H02' abapSystemSizeOfPersistence: 4 abapSystemSizeOfRuntime: 1 Clone Repositories: strategy: 'Clone' repositories: 'repositories.yml' ATC: # In order to be executed, the ATC stage needs at least one configuration entry # If the ATC stage should not be executed, delete the whole section execute: stage AUnit: # In order to be executed, the AUnit stage needs at least one configuration entry # If the AUnit stage should not be executed, delete the whole section execute: stage Post: cfDeleteServiceKeys: true Some stages may only be executed if a certain condition is met. For example: the stage Prepare System will only be executed if it is configured in the stages section. Also, the created system will be deprovisioned in the cleanup routine - although it is necessary to configure the step cloudFoundryDeleteService in the Post stage as shown above. Prepare system \u00b6 The example values for the Prepare System stage are a suggestion. Please change them accordingly and don't forget to enter your own email address. Please be aware that creating a SAP BTP, ABAP environment instance may incur costs. Please have a look at the step documentation for more details. Clone Repositories \u00b6 If the Clone Repositories stage is configured, you can specify the strategy that should be performed on the software components and the branches that you have configured in the respositories.yml file in step 3. Configuration for Cloning the repositories . Per default the strategy will be set to Pull if not specified. The following strategies are supported and can be used on the software components and branches: Pull : If you have specified Pull as the strategy the abapEnvironmentPullGitRepo step will be used Clone : If you have specified the Clone strategy the abapEnvironmentCloneGitRepo step will be used CheckoutPull : This strategy performs a Checkout of Branches with the abapEnvironmentCheckoutBranch step followed by a Pull of the Software Component with the abapEnvironmentPullGitRepo step Note that you can use the repositories.yml file with the repositories parameter consistently for all strategies. The values for cfApiEndpoint , cfOrg and cfSpace can be found in the respective overview pages in the SAP BTP cockpit. The SAP BTP / Cloud Foundry credentials, saved in the Jenkins credentials store with the ID cfCredentialsId , must refer to a user with the required authorizations (\"Space Developer\") for the SAP BTP / Cloud Foundry organization and space. ATC & AUnit \u00b6 The ATC and AUnit stage will be executed, if the config.yml file contains an entry for the respective stage. If you are using the default configuration a placeholder entry execute: stage has to be added in order to activate the stages. If you are using a dedicated configuration file - atcConfig.yml and aunitConfig.yml - this is not necessary. 7. Create a Jenkins Pipeline \u00b6 On your Jenkins server click on New Item to create a new pipeline. Provide a name and select the type Pipeline . On the creation screen for the pipeline, scroll to the section Pipeline and select Pipeline script from SCM . Provide the URL (and credentials - if required) of the repository, in which you configured the pipeline. Make sure the Script Path points to your Jenkinsfile - if you created the Jenkinsfile according to the documentation above, the default value should be correct. If you want to configure a build trigger, this can be done in the section of the same name. Here is one example: to run the pipeline every night, you can tick the box \"Run periodically\". In the visible input field, you can specify a shedule. Click on the questionsmark to read the documentation. The following example will result in the pipeline running every night between 3am and 4am. H H(3-4) * * * Make sure to check the general option \"Do not allow concurrent builds\" in order to prevent concurrent build processes. Stage Names \u00b6 The stage name for the extension is usually the displayed name, e.g. ATC.groovy or Prepare System.groovy . One exception is the generated Post stage. While the displayed name is \"Declarative: Post Actions\", you can extend this stage using Post.groovy . Extension \u00b6 You can extend each stage of this pipeline following the general extensibility documentation and the specific ABAP Environment pipeline extensibility documentation .","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"pipelines/abapEnvironment/configuration/#configuration","text":"In general, the SAP BTP, ABAP environment pipeline supports different scenarios.

The idea is that only configured stages are executed and the user is able to choose the appropriate stages. In this section, you can learn how to extend the SAP BTP, ABAP environment pipeline with our recommended and best-practice approaches. 1. Extend the ATC stage via the Checkstyle/Warnings Next Generation Plugin \u00b6 The ATC stage will execute ATC checks on a SAP BTP ABAP environment system via the step abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck . These results will be pinned to the respective Jenkins Jobs as an XML file in Checkstyle format. Per default this file will be named ATCResults.xml . You can change the file name via the step parameter atcResultsFileName . Jenkins offers the possibility to display the ATC results utilizing the checkstyle format with the Warnings Next Generation Plugin ( GitHub Project ). To achieve this, create a file .pipeline/extensions/ATC.groovy with the following content: void call ( Map params ) { //access stage name echo \"Start - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" //access config echo \"Current stage config: ${params.config}\" //execute original stage as defined in the template params . originalStage () recordIssues tools: [ checkStyle ( pattern: '**/ATCResults.xml' )], qualityGates: [[ threshold: 1 , type: 'TOTAL' , unstable: true ]] echo \"End - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" } return this The Jenkins pipeline step recordIssues captures the results: While tools: [checkStyle(pattern: '**/**/ATCResults.xml')] will display the ATC findings using the checkstyle format, qualityGates: [[threshold: 1, type: 'TOTAL', unstable: true]] will set the build result to UNSTABLE in case the ATC results contain at least one warning or error in total. You can define several quality gates that will be checked after the issues have been reported. For example by providing a qualityGates configuration with option unstable: false it would be possible to end the pipeline execution in case of findings. See Quality gate configuration for details. If the pipeline execution should be aborted in case of ATC findings, to not continue with execution of following pipeline stages, use the error step in the stage extension to cause the build to stop: if ( currentBuild . result == 'FAILURE' ) { error ( 'Stopping build due to ATC Check quality gate' ) } Local Jenkins If you are using a local Jenkins you may have to adapt the Jenkins URL in the configuration if the CheckStyle Plugin shows this error: \"Can't create fingerprints for some files\". 2. Extend the ATC stage to send ATC results via E-Mail \u00b6 In general when executing the ATC stage, the respective ATC results will normally be pinned to the Jenkins Job in a checkStyle XML format. Additionally, you can set the generateHTML flag to true for the abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck step. This includes the generation of an HTML document containing the ATC results for the abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck step that will also be pinned to the respective Jenkins Job. The ATC results can be attached to an E-Mail or being sent as the E-Mail body with the Email Extension Plugin ( GitHub Project ) using the emailext() method. Make sure that you have configured the Email Extension Plugin correctly before using it. In the following example we only provide a sample configuration using the Jenkins Email Extension Plugin . The E-Mail can be fully customized to your needs. Please refer to the Email Extension Plugin Documentation to see the full list of parameter that are supported. If you haven't created it already, create/extend the file .pipeline/extensions/ATC.groovy with the following content: void call ( Map params ) { //access stage name echo \"Start - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" //access config echo \"Current stage config: ${params.config}\" //execute original stage as defined in the template params . originalStage () emailext ( attachmentsPattern: 'ATCResults.html' , //This will attach the ATC results to the E-Mail to: 'user@example.com, admin@example.com' , subject: \"ATC results Mail from latest Run in System H01\" , body: 'Dear User, here are the results from the latest ATC run ${env.BUILD_ID}.' + readFile ( 'ATCResults.html' ) //This will parse the ATC results and send it as the E-Mail body ) echo \"End - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" } return this Note that in above example the ATC results, stored in the ATCResults.html file that is pinned to the Jenkins Job, will be sent as an attachmend using the attachmentsPattern parameter as well as being parsed and attached to the E-Mail body using the body parameter. Both methods are possible. If you chose to include the ATC results in the E-Mail body make sure to read the file content properly, e.g. using the readFile() method. The subject parameter defines the subject of the E-Mail that will be sent. The to parameter specifies a list of recipients separated by a comma. You can also set a Distribution Lists as a recipient. For all parameters it is also possible to use Jenkins environment variables like ${env.BUILD_ID} or ${env.JENKINS_URL} . 3. Extend the AUnit stage via the JUnit Plugin \u00b6 The AUnit stage will execute AUnit test runs on a SAP BTP ABAP environment system via the step abapEnvironmentRunAUnitTest . These results will be pinned to the respective Jenkins Jobs as an XML file in the JUnit format. Per default this file will be named AUnitResults.xml . You can change the file name via the step parameter aUnitResultsFileName . Jenkins offers the possibility to display the AUnit results utilizing the JUnit format with the JUnit Plugin ( GitHub Project ). To achieve this, create a file .pipeline/extensions/AUnit.groovy with the following content: void call ( Map params ) { //access stage name echo \"Start - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" //access config echo \"Current stage config: ${params.config}\" //execute original stage as defined in the template params . originalStage () junit skipPublishingChecks: true , allowEmptyResults: true , testResults: '**/AUnitResults.xml' echo \"End - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" } return this You can simply use the JUnit Plugin for Jenkins in the AUnit stage within the .pipeline/extensions/AUnit.groovy file by using the junit command. You can set optional parameters like skipPublishingChecks: true in order to disable an integration to the GitHub Checks API. allowEmptyResults: true allows the build status of the Jenkins run to be SUCCESS even if there have been no results from the respective AUnit test run in the test results file. Vice versa, allowEmptyResults: false will set the build status to FAILURE if the test results file contains no results. The testResults parameter specifies the path to the AUnit test results file which has been saved and pinned to the Jenkins job in the abapEnvironmentRunAUnitTest step. Please refer to the documentation of the ( JUnit Plugin ) for more detailled information on the usage and configuration of the JUnit plugin parameters. 4. Extend the AUnit stage to send AUnit results via E-Mail \u00b6 In general when executing the AUnit stage, the respective AUnit results will normally be pinned to the Jenkins Job in a JUnit XML format. Additionally, you can set the generateHTML flag to true for the abapEnvironmentRunAUnitTest step. This includes the generation of an HTML document containing the AUnit results for the abapEnvironmentRunAUnitTest step that will also be pinned to the respective Jenkins Job.

If you haven't created it already, create/extend the file .pipeline/extensions/AUnit.groovy with the following content: void call ( Map params ) { //access stage name echo \"Start - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" //access config echo \"Current stage config: ${params.config}\" //execute original stage as defined in the template params . originalStage () emailext ( attachmentsPattern: 'AUnitResults.html' , //This will attach the AUnit results to the E-Mail to: 'user@example.com, admin@example.com' , subject: \"AUnit results Mail from latest Run in System H01\" , body: 'Dear User, here are the results from the latest AUnit test run ${env.BUILD_ID}.' + readFile ( 'AUnitResults.html' ) //This will parse the AUnit results and send it as the E-Mail body ) echo \"End - Extension for stage: ${params.stageName}\" } return this Note that in above example the AUnit test run results, stored in the AUnitResults.html file that is pinned to the Jenkins job, will be sent as an attachment using the attachmentsPattern parameter as well as being parsed and attached to the E-Mail body using the body parameter. Both methods are possible. If you chose to include the AUnit test run results in the E-Mail body make sure to read the file content properly, e.g. using the readFile() method. The subject parameter defines the subject of the E-Mail that will be sent. The to parameter specifies a list of recipients separated by a comma. You can also set a distribution list as a recipient. For all parameters it is also possible to use Jenkins environment variables like ${env.BUILD_ID} or ${env.JENKINS_URL} .","title":"4.

Context \u00b6 This procedure explains how to upload a multitarget application (MTA) from a CI/CD pipeline to Cloud Transport Management and then import it into its target environment. Cloud Transport Management allows you to manage the transport of development artifacts and application-specific content between different SAP BTP accounts. It adds transparency to the audit trail of changes so that you get information about who performed which changes in your production accounts and when they did it. At the same time, Cloud Transport Management enables a separation of concerns: For example, a developer of an application or of SAP Cloud content artifacts can trigger the propagation of changes, while the resulting transport is handled by a central operations team. For more information, see SAP Cloud Transport Management . The following graphic provides an overview about the interplay between continuous integration and Cloud Transport Management: Prerequisites \u00b6 You have an existing CI pipeline, which you want to extend with Cloud Transport Management. You have an multitarget application (MTA) project, and the folder structure of its sources corresponds to the standard MTA structure. For more information about MTAs, see: Multitarget Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment Multitarget Applications for the Neo Environment You have access to Cloud Transport Management. See Provide Access to SAP Cloud Transport Management . You have set up Cloud Transport Management and created a service key. See Set Up the Environment to Transport Content Archives directly in an Application . You have configured your transport landscape. See Configuring the Landscape . Procedure \u00b6 You can use this scenario to extend any CI process that meets the prerequisites, for example, the one described in Build and Deploy SAPUI5 or SAP Fiori Applications on SAP BTP with Jenkins . The following graphic shows an example of the detailed procedure when combining continuous integration and Cloud Transport Management: The process flow contains the following steps: The CI server builds a MTA archive. The MTA is uploaded into the import queue of the target node, which is specified in the CI pipeline (in this example, PRE-PROD). Optionally, for transports in Cloud Foundry environment, MTA extension descriptors can be uploaded to the nodes in the transport landscape to provide node-specific import configurations. The MTA extension descriptor file must either be part of the repository, or be the result of the build process. The release manager manually triggers the import, or schedules it, which results in the physical deployment of the MTA archive into the corresponding subaccount (in this example, PRE-PROD). If an MTA extension descriptor was uploaded for this node, it will be used for the import. As soon as the import is executed, a transport is triggered along the defined transport route so that the MTA archive reaches the import queue of the next node (in this example, PROD). There, the physical import into the corresponding subaccount can be either triggered manually by the release manager or automatically by using the scheduling mechanisms of Cloud Transport Management. Example \u00b6 Jenkinsfile \u00b6 If you use the pipeline of the following code snippet, you only have to configure it in the .pipeline/config.yml.

The possibility to deliver individual table keys as part of add-on build might be supported at a later point in time. Required project \"Piper\" library version The recommended project \"Piper\" library version can be found in SAP Note 3032800 . A specific version can be used by referencing the version number in the Jenkinsfile . Introduction \u00b6 This scenario describes how an add-on for the SAP BTP, ABAP environment is built. It is intended for SAP partners who want to provide a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution on the SAP BTP using the ABAP Environment. Therefore, a partner development contract (see SAP PartnerEdge Test, Demo & Development Price List ) is required. This page aims to provide an overview of the build process of the add-on. The development on SAP BTP, ABAP environment systems is done within \u201csoftware components\u201d (also called: \u201crepositories\u201d). The add-ons being built in this scenario are made up by one or multiple software components combined to an add-on product. The \u201cABAP environment pipeline\u201d can be used to build and publish the add-on product. Please read on for more details about the Add-on Product and the build process. Of course, this tackles only the upstream part of the SaaS solution lifecycle. Once the add-on is published, it can be consumed as a multitenant application in ABAP environment . A comprehensive guidance on how to develop and operate SaaS applications using add-ons, can be found here . The Add-on Product \u00b6 The installation and maintenance of ABAP software is controlled via add-on product versions. An add-on product version is a \u201ebundle\" of software component versions made available at the same time for implementing a well-defined scope of functionality. It is the delivery view on a software portfolio. Add-on Product Version \u00b6 An add-on product version is defined by a name and a version string. The name of an add-on product is a string with a maximum of 30 characters and consists of the namespace and a freely chooseble part - /NAMESPC/PRODUCTX . The add-on product name should only include uppercase characters. The version string consists of three numbers separated by a dot - 1.2.0 . The numbers in the version string have a hierarchic relationship: The first number denotes the release . Release deliveries contain the complete scope of functionality. It is possible to change the software component version bundle in a new release. The second number denotes the support package stack level . A support package stack consists of support package deliveries of the contained software component versions. The third number denotes the patch level . A Patch delivery contains patch deliveries of the contained software component versions. Software Component Version \u00b6 Development on SAP BTP, ABAP environment As you may know, the development in the SAP BTP, ABAP environment is done within software components . A software component is self-contained, and a reduced set of objects and features of the ABAP programming language can be used. The software component and development objects must be created in a namespace, so that clashes between software of different vendors and SAP are avoided. Therefore, a namespace must be reserved before the development can start. SAP Note 105132 describes the namespace reservation process. The namespace must be reserved for the same customer number under which the \u201cSAP BTP, ABAP ENVIRONMENT\u201d tenants are licensed. A software component version is a technically distinguishable unit of software and is installed and patched as a whole. It consists of ABAP development packages and contained objects. Software component versions are delivered via delivery packages. But software component versions are not individual shipment entities. They can only be delivered to customers as part of an add-on product version . A software component version is defined by a name and a version string. The name of a software component is a string with a maximum of 30 characters and consists of the namespace and a freely chooseble part - /NAMESPC/COMPONENTA . The version consists of three numbers separated by a dot - 1.2.0 . The numbers in the version string have a hierarchic relationship: The first number denotes the release . Release deliveries contain the whole software component and should be used to deliver new functionalities or feature enhancements. They are provided with delivery packages of type Add-on Installation (AOI) and are usually created on a regular basis (e.g. quarterly). The second number denotes the support package level . Support package deliveries contain either the objects that were changed since the previous release delivery or since the previous support package delivery. They should be used to deliver a collection of patch deliveries or to deliver smaller functional enhancements. They are provided with delivery packages of type Component Support Package (CSP) and are usually created on a regular basis (e.g. bi-weekly). The third number denotes the patch level . Patch deliveries contain only those objects that were changed since the previous patch delivery. They should be used to deliver bugfixes and are only created when necessary (e.g. emergency patch). The type of delivery does not need to be chosen manually; it is automatically determined by the delivery tools. Software Component Versions are uniquely created and independent from the add-on product versions where they are included. This means that once a software component version was built, it will be reused in any following add-on product versions. Target Vector \u00b6 As explained above, the shipment of a software takes place via add-on product versions. The delivered content of an add-on product version is defined in a target vector, which is used by the deployment tools. The target vector is derived from the addon.yml (more on that below) and contains the following information: Product name Product release Product Support Package stack and Patch level A list of contained software component versions with Software component name Software component release Delivery Package, which delivers the software component version In ABAP Environment Pipeline stage Build a target vector for the particular add-on product version is published in test scope. This makes it possible to perform an add-on test installation in stage Integration Tests . At this point the new add-on product version is not available for add-on updates and can only be installed during system provisioning in the Integration Tests stage. In stage Publish the target vector is then published in production scope, so that the new version will become available for add-on update and installation during system provisioning. Building the Add-on Product \u00b6 The build process of an add-on product is orchestrated by a Jenkins Pipeline, the ABAP Environment Pipeline provided in this project. To run this pipeline, it only needs to be configured \u2013 which will be explained in the sections \u201cPrerequisites\u201d and \u201cConfiguration\u201d. The pipeline consists of different steps responsible for a single task. The steps themselves are grouped thematically into different stages. For example, early in the pipeline, an ABAP environment system needs to be created and the communication needs to be set up. This is done in the \u201cPrepare System\u201d stage. You can read more about the different stages in the ABAP environment pipeline documentation . Different services and systems are required for the add-on build process. Delivery Tools \u00b6 With the following tools the add-on deliveries are created. Assembly System \u00b6 Minimum Platform Version The ABAP Environment platform version of the assembly system is used to determine the minimum platform version for the add-on product version that is created. Such a system should not be nominated for the pre-upgrade option of ABAP Environment since then the add-on production could only be installed in systems with the pre-upgrade release. API Snapshots During the add-on build any changes to released APIs will be checked for compatibility. The corresponding ATC check can only function properly if there is an API snapshot available in the assembly system. Therefore, make sure to use a permanent system for the assembly if you need to fulfill consistency and stability criteria for your released APIs. Refer to Checking the Compatibility of Released APIs . The ABAP system responsible for building packages based on software components in the systems. All actions related to the ABAP source code are executed on this system, e.g. running checks with the ABAP test cockpit (ATC) or the physical build of the software components. There are two communication scenarios containing the different APIs of the ABAP environment system: Test Integration and Software Assembly Integration . The assembly system should be of service abap/standard and be provisioned with parameter is_development_allowed = false to prevent local changes. Add-on Assembly Kit as a Service (=AAKaaS) \u00b6 The Add-on Assembly Kit as a Service is responsible for registering and publishing the add-on product. On a high level it is a service offered in the SAP Service & Support systems (thus access is granted via Technical Communication User) that, similar to the Software Delivery Assembler (SDA, transaction SSDA) as part of the SAP Add-On Assembly Kit , packs the deliveries into an importable package format. Deployment Tools \u00b6 With these SAP tools the assembled add-on deliveries are deployed to ABAP systems, for example into the installation test system . Installation Test System \u00b6 In order to verify that the delivery packages included in the add-on product version are installable, a target vector is published in \"test\" scope. In the Integration Tests stage an ABAP system of service abap/saas_oem is created. This makes it possible to install a specific add-on product version into an ABAP system that is provisioned. The installation test system should be be provisioned with the parameter is_development_allowed = false to prevent local changes. Prerequisites \u00b6 There are several prerequisites to run the pipeline for building an ABAP Environment add-on: Jenkins Server \u00b6 The pipeline responsible for building ABAP add-ons has been created specifically for Jenkins . Therefore, a Jenkins Server is required. Please follow these instructions to configure an existing server . Git Repository \u00b6 The pipeline configuration is done in a git repository (for example on GitHub). This repository needs to be accessed by the Jenkins Server. If the repository is password protected, the user and password (or access token) should be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store (Manage Jenkins \u2192 Manage Credentials). Add-on Assembly Kit as a Service (=AAKaaS) \u00b6 The communication with the AAKaaS needs a technical communication user. The creation and activation of such a user is described in SAP note 2174416 . Make sure that this technical communication user is assigned to the customer number under which the SAP BTP, ABAP Environment instances are licensed and for which the development namespace was reserved. The user and password need to be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store. Cloud Foundry Access \u00b6 ABAP environment systems are created in the SAP BTP cockpit. For this pipeline, the creation and deletion of the systems are automated via the Cloud Foundry command line interface: cf CLI . For this to work, two things need to be configured: Cloud Foundry needs to be enabled on subaccount level. This can be done on the Subaccount Overview page. The subaccount is then mapped to a \u201cCloud Foundry Organization\u201d, for which you must provide a suitable name during the creation. Have a look at the documentation for more details. A (technical) platform user is required to access the Cloud Foundry Org and Space via the cf CLI. The user needs to be assigned as space member including Space Developer role in order to create/read service instances and service keys. The user and password need to be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store. Later, during the pipeline configuration, you will specify the service plan, which will be used for the creation of an ABAP environment system. Please make sure that there are enough entitlements for this assigned to the subaccount . Register Add-on Product for a Global Account \u00b6 The registration of a new add-on product is a manual step. Your add-on product should only be installed in ABAP systems in your global accounts for development and production. Therefore, the product needs to be created and global accounts need to be registered with SAP using Landscape Portal. See Register Product . Configuration \u00b6 In the following subsections, the pipeline configuration for this scenario is explained. Please refer to the configuration page for general configuration. ATC \u00b6 We recommend to configure the add-on build pipeline with a quality gate to block any error and warning ATC findings . This can be configured with a quality gate configuration [threshold: 1, type: 'TOTAL_ERROR', unstable: false] and [threshold: 1, type: 'TOTAL_NORMAL', unstable: false] in the recordIssues pipeline step shown in Extend the ATC stage via the Checkstyle/Warnings Next Generation Plugin . Created delivery packages for an add-on product version are final, so to fix any errors in these packages, another add-on product version would have to be built. ATC findings should be resolved during development as early as possible, e.g. during transport release and by using an additional pipeline configured for the Continuous Testing on SAP BTP, ABAP Environment scenario . Please include all software components configured in addon.yml file also in the atcConfig.yml file. In case not all software components are included, some errors might not be found. Add-on descriptor file \u00b6 The build process is controlled by an add-on descriptor file called addon.yml . This file must be created manually and must be stored in the GIT repository of the pipeline. It must contain information about the to-be-delivered add-on product version and the contained software component versions . Below, you see an example: --- addonProduct : \"/NAMESPC/PRODUCTX\" addonVersion : \"1.2.0\" repositories : - name : \"/NAMESPC/COMPONENTA\" branch : \"v1.2.0\" version : \"1.2.0\" commitID : \"7d4516e9\" languages : - DE - EN - name : \"/NAMESPC/COMPONENTB\" branch : \"v2.0.0\" version : \"2.0.0\" commitID : \"9f102ffb\" languages : - DE - EN - FR Explanation of the keys: addonProduct : this is the technical name of the add-on product addonVersion : This is the technical version of the add-on product <product version>.<support package stack level>.<patch level> The section repositories contains one or multiple software component versions: name : the technical name of the software component branch : this is the branch from the git repository version : this is the technical software component version <software component version>.<support package level>.<patch level> commitID : this is the commitID from the git repository languages : specify the languages to be delivered according to ISO-639. For all deliveries of an Add-on Product Version, the languages should not change. If languages should be added, a new Add-on Product Version must be created. addonVersion influences solely the creation of the target vector . Without target vector nothing can be deployed. But it is possible to deploy combinations which have been build in the past (especially if the same software component version is part of multiple add-on products). As a rule of thumb, the addonVersion should be increased analogous to the version of the leading software component. An exception can be the patch level in the addonVersion string: In case of an add-on product with a reuse software component, the patch level of the addonVersion might be higher than the patch level of the leading software component version . The leading software component is the software component that is, as opposed to a reuse software component, exclusively used as part of one add-on product. In the repositories section of the add-on descriptor file the reuse software component should be the first, whereas a leading software component would be the last in order. This is to make sure that that the software components are imported in the correct order, making sure to adhere to dependencies. Software Component Dependencies In case the involved software components have dependencies between them, define them in software component relations . The version of a software component influcences two aspects: The given version will be used as part of the target vector If there exists no delivery package with the given version in AAKaaS the build of this package is performed As a result, if the addonVersion is increased but references a software component version for which a delivery package has already been created, no new delivery package is built but only a new target vector is created. During add-on update such a target vector does not reference any new software component versions and the update of software components is skipped. If the version of a software component is increased but not the addonVersion , a package is built but no new target vector is created, meaning the new package cannot be deployed. If the add-on product consists of multiple software component versions, but only for one of them the version is increased (together with a new commitID ), only for this software component version a new package will be created. If, at the same time, the addonVersion is increased a new target vector will be created. The commitID identifies a specific state of a software component and should only be changed while also adjusting the version number of a software component. Versioning Rules \u00b6 For the development and the provisioning of product-/software component versions, it is necessary to ensure, that there are no gaps within the version and level counters. Therefore, only a continuous increase in version numbers is allowed. The following examples show valid and invalid cases, respectively: Valid increase: 1.0.0 to 2.0.0 1.1.2 to 2.0.0 2.0.0 to 2.0.1 2.1.0 to 2.2.0 2.1.1 to 2.1.2 Invalid increase: 1.0.0 to 3.0.0 (version 2.0.0 is missing; therefore, a product/component version is missing) 1.1.2 to 2.1.0 (version 2.0.0 is missing; therefore, a product/component version is missing) 2.0.0 to 2.0.2 (version 2.0.1 is missing; therefore, a patch level is missing) 2.1.0 to 2.3.0 (version 2.2.0 is missing; therefore, a support package level is missing) 2.1.1 to 2.1.3 (version 2.1.2 is missing; therefore, a patch level is missing) Technically, the allowed number range for add-on product version and software component version is 1.0.0 to 9999.9999.9999. The support package level of software component version can only go up until 369 because of technical limitations. For the patch level, there is a technical limit of 36\u00b3, limited to 9999. Example \u00b6 Please have a look at the configuration example to build and publish add-on products using a transient assembly system . As an alternative you can refer to the example using a permanent assembly system . Troubleshooting \u00b6 If you encounter an issue with the pipeline itself, please open an issue in GitHub . Once execution of the Build stage, in particular the abapAddonAssemblyKitRegisterPackages step, has been completed, errors must be resolved by creating new software component versions with the correct configuration. Pipeline steps can be restarted without causing double execution of already perfomed steps (intermediate results are stored). Common Issues \u00b6 In case of an error during execution of the pipeline steps: Stage: Prepare System Step: abapEnvironmentCreateSystem A service instance for the selected plan cannot be created in this organization or Quota is not sufficient for this request. ABAP System provisioning requires sufficient entitlements for abap/standard as well as abap/hana_compute_unit and abap/abap_compute_unit to be assigned to the subaccount. Stage: Clone Repositories Step: abapEnvironmentPullGitRepo e.g. A4C_A2G/000 - Branch checkout for /NAMESPC/COMPONENTA is currently performed; Try again later... Parallel execution of multiple actions on the same software component (like checkout, pull etc.) is not supported. Stage: ATC Step: abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck Long-running step execution Create a custom check variant and utilize ATC Exemptions to reduce the test scope and irrelevant findings. Resolve ATC findings early on during development, e.g. by working with ATC during transport release . Stage: Build Step: abapAddonAssemblyKitReserveNextPackages e.g. Package SAPK00C001CPITAPC1 was already build but with commit d5ffb9717a57c9e65d9e4c8366ea45be958b56cc, not with 86d70dc3 New commitID , but no new software component version in add-on descriptor: Only by changing the version a new delivery package is created. e.g. CommitID of package SAPK00C002CPITAPC1 is the same as the one of the predecessor package. New Patch Level of software component, but same commitID in add-on descriptor: The same commitID cannot be used as previous/current commit id for a correction package. Stage: Integration Tests Step: abapEnvironmentCreateSystem A service instance for the selected plan cannot be created in this organization or Quota is not sufficient for this request. ABAP System provisioning requires sufficient entitlements for abap/saas_oem as well as abap/hana_compute_unit and abap/abap_compute_unit to be assigned to the subaccount. Product installation failed because AddOn XYZ has not been registered in PPMS for productive development The add-on product is not yet registered for add-on installation, please follow steps in Register Add-on Product for a Global Account #register-add-on-product-for-a-global-account Stage: Post Step: cloudFoundryDeleteService Add-on assembly system is deleted unexpectedly Create a Piper extension of the Post stage, similar to Post.groovy Support Components \u00b6 If issues cannot be resolved, please open a support incident on the respective support component: Stage Steps Support Component Initial Checks abapAddonAssemblyKitCheckPV , abapAddonAssemblyKitCheckCVs BC-UPG-OCS Prepare System abapEnvironmentCreateSystem , cloudFoundryCreateServiceKey BC-CP-ABA Clone Repositories abapEnvironmentPullGitRepo BC-CP-ABA-SC ATC abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck BC-DWB-TOO-ATF AUnit abapEnvironmentRunAUnitTest BC-DWB-TOO-ATF Build cloudFoundryCreateServiceKey BC-CP-ABA abapAddonAssemblyKitReserveNextPackages BC-UPG-OCS abapEnvironmentAssemblePackages , abapEnvironmentBuild BC-UPG-ADDON abapAddonAssemblyKitRegisterPackages BC-UPG-OCS abapEnvironmentAssembleConfirm BC-UPG-ADDON abapAddonAssemblyKitReleasePackages , abapAddonAssemblyKitCreateTargetVector , abapAddonAssemblyKitPublishTargetVector BC-UPG-OCS Integration Tests abapEnvironmentCreateSystem , cloudFoundryDeleteService BC-CP-ABA Publish abapAddonAssemblyKitPublishTargetVector BC-UPG-OCS Post cloudFoundryDeleteService BC-CP-ABA Note: Always attach the pipeline execution log ouput to the support incident, if possible including timestamps by using the Timestamper Jenkins plugin .

The development on SAP BTP, ABAP environment systems is done within \u201csoftware components\u201d (also called: \u201crepositories\u201d). The add-ons being built in this scenario are made up by one or multiple software components combined to an add-on product.

A software component is self-contained, and a reduced set of objects and features of the ABAP programming language can be used. The software component and development objects must be created in a namespace, so that clashes between software of different vendors and SAP are avoided. Therefore, a namespace must be reserved before the development can start. SAP Note 105132 describes the namespace reservation process. The namespace must be reserved for the same customer number under which the \u201cSAP BTP, ABAP ENVIRONMENT\u201d tenants are licensed. A software component version is a technically distinguishable unit of software and is installed and patched as a whole. It consists of ABAP development packages and contained objects. Software component versions are delivered via delivery packages. But software component versions are not individual shipment entities. They can only be delivered to customers as part of an add-on product version . A software component version is defined by a name and a version string. The name of a software component is a string with a maximum of 30 characters and consists of the namespace and a freely chooseble part - /NAMESPC/COMPONENTA . The version consists of three numbers separated by a dot - 1.2.0 . The numbers in the version string have a hierarchic relationship: The first number denotes the release . Release deliveries contain the whole software component and should be used to deliver new functionalities or feature enhancements. They are provided with delivery packages of type Add-on Installation (AOI) and are usually created on a regular basis (e.g. quarterly). The second number denotes the support package level . Support package deliveries contain either the objects that were changed since the previous release delivery or since the previous support package delivery. They should be used to deliver a collection of patch deliveries or to deliver smaller functional enhancements. They are provided with delivery packages of type Component Support Package (CSP) and are usually created on a regular basis (e.g. bi-weekly). The third number denotes the patch level . Patch deliveries contain only those objects that were changed since the previous patch delivery. They should be used to deliver bugfixes and are only created when necessary (e.g. emergency patch). The type of delivery does not need to be chosen manually; it is automatically determined by the delivery tools.

During add-on update such a target vector does not reference any new software component versions and the update of software components is skipped. If the version of a software component is increased but not the addonVersion , a package is built but no new target vector is created, meaning the new package cannot be deployed. If the add-on product consists of multiple software component versions, but only for one of them the version is increased (together with a new commitID ), only for this software component version a new package will be created. If, at the same time, the addonVersion is increased a new target vector will be created. The commitID identifies a specific state of a software component and should only be changed while also adjusting the version number of a software component.","title":"Add-on descriptor file"},{"location":"scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/#versioning-rules","text":"For the development and the provisioning of product-/software component versions, it is necessary to ensure, that there are no gaps within the version and level counters.

In Steampunk, the development is done within \u201csoftware components\u201d (also called: \u201crepositories\u201d) and \"transported\" via git-based approaches. The ABAP environment pipeline is a predefined pipeline, which can be used to import ABAP development into a quality system and execute tests. Pipeline \u00b6 For this scenario three stages of the ABAP environment pipeline are relevant: \"Prepare System\", \"Clone Repositories\" and \"ATC\". Prepare System \u00b6 The pipeline starts with the stage \"Prepare System\". This stage, however, is optional. If this stage is active , a new Steampunk system is created for each pipeline execution. This has the advantage that each test runs on a fresh system without a history. On the other hand, the duration of each pipeline execution will increase as the system provisioning takes a significant amount of time. If this stage is not active , you have to provide a prepared Steampunk (quality) system for the other stages. Then, each pipeline execution runs on the same system. Of course, the system has a history, but the pipeline duration will be shorter. Please also consider: the total costs may increase for a static system in contrast to a system, which is only active during the pipeline. Clone Repositories \u00b6 This stage is responsible for cloning (or pulling) the defined software components (repositories) to the system. Run Tests \u00b6 This stage will trigger the execution of the ATC and AUnit stages in parallel. Please find more information on the respective stages below. ATC \u00b6 In this stage, ATC checks can be executed using abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck . The step can receive software components or packages. The results are returned in the checkstyle format and can be displayed using the Warnings Next Generation Plugin . To display the results it is necessary to extend the ATC stage via the Checkstyle/Warnings Next Generation Plugin . AUnit \u00b6 This stage will triger an AUnit run on the SAP BTP, APAB environment system. You can configure the object set that should be checked during the AUnit run. The results of the test run are returned in the \"JUnit\" format. It is possible to further visualize the AUnit test run results with the help of a stage extension. Prerequisites \u00b6 There are several parts that are required to run the pipeline. Jenkins Server \u00b6 The pipeline for testing software components has been created specifically for Jenkins . Therefore, a Jenkins server is required. The project \"Piper\" provides a Jenkins image, which already includes the necessary configurations. Of course, it is also possible to configure an existing server . Git Repository \u00b6 The pipeline configuration is done in a git repository (for example on GitHub). This repository needs to be accessed by the Jenkins server. If the repository is password protected, the user and password (or access token) should be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store (Manage Jenkins \u2192 Manage Credentials). Cloud Foundry Access \u00b6 ABAP environment systems are created in the SAP BTP cockpit. For this pipeline, the creation and deletion of the systems are automated via the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface: cf CLI . For this to work, two things need to be configured: Cloud Foundry needs to be enabled on subaccount level. This can be done on the Subaccount Overview page. The subaccount is then mapped to a \u201cCloud Foundry Organization\u201d, for which you must provide a suitable name during the creation. Have a look at the documentation for more details. A (technical) user is required to access the SAP BTP via the cf CLI. The user needs to be a member of the global account and has to have the Space Developer role.

Note: This is only required if you don't use a Docker-based environment. Context \u00b6 In many SAP development scenarios, it is vital to synchronize both backend and frontend deliveries. These deliveries are typically an SAPUI5 application and an ABAP backend from which it is served. The SAPUI5 parts are often developed using agile practices and use Continuous Integration pipelines that automatically build, test, and deploy the application. Note This scenario description is an example. You can apply the process to other scenarios and component sets, as well. In this scenario, we want to show how an agile development process with Jenkins CI can automatically feed changes into SAP Solution Manager. In SAP Solution Manager, all parts of the application stack come together and can be subject to classic change and transport management. The basic workflow is as follows: The pipeline scans the Git commit messages for a line like ChangeDocument : <changeDocumentId> , and validates that the change is in the correct status in development . For more information, see checkChangeInDevelopment . An example for the commit message looks as follows: Fix terminology in documentation Terminology must be consistent with official channels.

To communicate with SAP Solution Manager, the pipeline uses credentials that must be stored on Jenkins using the credential ID CM . For more information, see checkChangeInDevelopment . The required transport request is created on the fly. Note: The change document can contain various components (for example, UI and backend components). The changes of your development team trigger the Jenkins pipeline. It builds and validates the changes and attaches them to the respective transport request.

It allows you to set up continuous integration processes for ABAP development. For current information about gCTS, see SAP Note 2821718 - Central Note for Git-enabled Change and Transport System (gCTS) . This scenario explains how to use a pipeline to deploy a commit to a test system, and execute ABAP unit tests and ATC (ABAP Test Cockpit) checks in the test system. For each new commit that arrives in the remote repository, the pipeline executes the following Piper steps in the test system: gctsDeploy : Deploys the commit on the test system. gctsExecuteABAPQualityChecks : Executes ABAP unit tests and ATC checks for the ABAP development objects of the commit. If the result of the testing is success , the pipeline finishes. If the result of the testing is error , a rollback is executed (see next step). Only in case of errors: gctsRollback : Executes a rollback to the previous commit. You can check the cause of the errors using the Warnings Next Generation Plugin in Jenkins. Prerequisites \u00b6 You have configured Git-Enabled Change and Transport System, and you use it for your ABAP development. See Configuring Git-enabled Change & Transport System (gCTS) You have a Git repository on a Git server, such as GitHub, or GitLab. The Git repository is usually created as part of the gCTS configuration. It is used to store your ABAP developments. You can use this Git repository also for the pipeline configuration. (Jenkinsfile) The repository used for the pipeline configuration needs to be accessed by the Jenkins instance. If the repository is password-protected, the user and password (or access token) should be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store ( Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials ). You have at least two ABAP systems with a version SAP S/4HANA 2020 or higher. You need one development system that you use to push objects to the Git repository, and a test system on which you run the pipeline. You have created and cloned the Git repository on all systems, on the development system with the Development role, and on the others with the Provided role. You have enabled ATC checks in transaction ATC in the test system. You have access to a Jenkins instance including the Warnings-Next-Generation Plugin . The plug-in must be installed separately. It is required to view the results of the testing after the pipeline has run. For the gCTS scenario, we recommend that you use the Custom Jenkins setup . You have set up a suitable Jenkins instance as described under Getting Started with Project \"Piper\" under Create Your First Pipeline . The user that is used for the execution of the pipeline must have the credentials entered in gCTS as described in the gCTS documentation under Set User-Specific Authentication . Process \u00b6 The pipeline process is as follows: You create or change ABAP objects in the development system. When you release the transport request, the objects are pushed to the remote repository in a new commit. The pipeline is triggered by the new commit. The pipeline can be started manually in Jenkins, or automatically when the new commit arrives in the Git repository (by setting a webhook on your Git server). For more information about webhooks on GitHub, see Creating webhooks . The pipeline deploys the new commit on the test system. If the deployment is successful, the pipeline executes ATC checks and ABAP Unit tests for the objects of the commit depending on the specified object scope. In the sample configuration provided below, this is localChangedObjects , which means, the checks are executed for all objects that were changed by the last activity in the local repository. If the checks don\u00b4t find any errors, the pipeline finishes. The test system remains on the new commit, and you can continue your testing activities, for example, using manual tests. If the checks find errors, the pipeline continues with the next step. In case of warnings or errors, the pipeline executes a rollback to the last active commit in the test system. You can display the errors and warnings of the checks in the Warnings-Next-Generation Plugin . For more information about the mapping of priorities and severities of the checks to statuses displayed in Jenkins, see the description of the following parameters in the description of the gctsExecuteABAPQualityChecks step: Severities of ABAP Unit test results: aUnitTest Priorities of ATC check results: atcCheck After analyzing the errors, you can correct the issues in the development system. Once you release the new transport request, the pipeline is triggered again. The following image shows the steps involved when the checks finish successfully: Image: Build and Deploy Process in Jenkins The following image shows the steps involved when the checks result in warnings or errors: Image: Build and Deploy Process in Jenkins Example \u00b6 To implement the gCTS scenario, create a Jenkinsfile in the root directory of your Git repository. The sample Jenkinsfile below contains all configuration information required. It is also possible to use an additional .pipeline/config.yml file for the configuration of the step parameters. But the config.yml is not required for the gCTS scenario described here. For more information, see the examples in the individual step descriptions.

You have created and cloned the Git repository on all systems, on the development system with the Development role, and on the others with the Provided role. You have enabled ATC checks in transaction ATC in the test system. You have access to a Jenkins instance including the Warnings-Next-Generation Plugin . The plug-in must be installed separately. It is required to view the results of the testing after the pipeline has run. For the gCTS scenario, we recommend that you use the Custom Jenkins setup . You have set up a suitable Jenkins instance as described under Getting Started with Project \"Piper\" under Create Your First Pipeline . The user that is used for the execution of the pipeline must have the credentials entered in gCTS as described in the gCTS documentation under Set User-Specific Authentication .","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"scenarios/gCTS_Scenario/#process","text":"The pipeline process is as follows: You create or change ABAP objects in the development system. When you release the transport request, the objects are pushed to the remote repository in a new commit. The pipeline is triggered by the new commit. The pipeline can be started manually in Jenkins, or automatically when the new commit arrives in the Git repository (by setting a webhook on your Git server). For more information about webhooks on GitHub, see Creating webhooks . The pipeline deploys the new commit on the test system. If the deployment is successful, the pipeline executes ATC checks and ABAP Unit tests for the objects of the commit depending on the specified object scope. In the sample configuration provided below, this is localChangedObjects , which means, the checks are executed for all objects that were changed by the last activity in the local repository. If the checks don\u00b4t find any errors, the pipeline finishes. The test system remains on the new commit, and you can continue your testing activities, for example, using manual tests. If the checks find errors, the pipeline continues with the next step. In case of warnings or errors, the pipeline executes a rollback to the last active commit in the test system. You can display the errors and warnings of the checks in the Warnings-Next-Generation Plugin . For more information about the mapping of priorities and severities of the checks to statuses displayed in Jenkins, see the description of the following parameters in the description of the gctsExecuteABAPQualityChecks step: Severities of ABAP Unit test results: aUnitTest Priorities of ATC check results: atcCheck After analyzing the errors, you can correct the issues in the development system. Once you release the new transport request, the pipeline is triggered again.

Which option to use depends on the version of your ABAP system. For AS ABAP 7.50 SP08, 7.51 SP07, or 7.52 SP03 and newer, use the OData-based upload, for older versions, use the RFC-based upload.

This document comprises the mtaBuild step and the transportRequestUploadRFC respectively the transportRequestUploadCTS step. In case of an RFC based upload the binary is not streamed to the ABAP endpoint. Instead an URL pointing to the binary needs to be provided. Hence the binary must be published first so that it can be accessed via HTTP. This can happen by uploading the binary to a blob store or by archiving the artifact on Jenkins. The corresponding URL needs to be provided when the artifact is attached to the transport request. The transport request can be created on the fly (see transportRequestCreate ) or we can use an already existing transport request. In case we use an already existing transport request Id the transport request Id needs to be provided in the git commit history (see transportRequestReqIDFromGit ) or the transport request Id needs to be provided inside the job (e.g. as a job parameter). The transport request can be closed by the pipeline job (see transportRequestRelease ). This is an example of a Git commit message containing the transport request ID: The headline The body.

First step: Pull Request Pipeline \u00b6 In order to validate pull-requests to your GitHub repository you need to perform two simple steps: 1. Create Pipeline configuration \u00b6 Create a file .pipeline/config.yml in your repository (typically in master branch) with the following content: general : buildTool : 'npm' buildTool Please make sure that you specify the correct build tool. Following are currently supported: docker kaniko maven mta npm If your build tool is not in the list you can still use further options as described for Pull-Request Voting Stage 2. Create Jenkinsfile \u00b6 Create a file called Jenkinsfile in the root of your repository (typically in master branch) with the following content: @Library ( 'piper-lib-os' ) _ piperPipeline script: this There is typically no need to further touch this file Using custom defaults It is possible to overwrite/extend the pipeline defaults with custom defaults. piperPipeline script: this, customDefaults: ['myCustomDefaults.yml'] You find more details about the custom defaults in the configuration section using dedicated versions It is possible to use a fixed version of the library using e.g. @Library('piper-lib-os@v1.222.0') _ Make sure to only use valid git tags as versions! Second step: Prepare pipeline for your main branch \u00b6 Extend your configuration to also contain git ssh credentials information. Your .pipeline/config.yml should then look like: general : buildTool : 'npm' gitSshKeyCredentialsId : 'credentials-id-in-jenkins' gitSshKeyCredentialsId The pointer to the Jenkins credentials containing your ssh private key is an important part of the pipeline run. The credentials are for example required to push automatic versioning information to your GitHub repository. Subsequent steps: Configure individual stages \u00b6 The stages of the pipeline can be configured individually. As a general rule of thumb, only stages with an existing configuration are executed. If no dedicated configuration is required for a step, the precence of relevant files in the repository trigger the step execution. This smart and context-aware way of configuration allows you an iterative approach to configuring the individual steps. The pipeline comprises following stages: Init \u00b6 This stage takes care that the pipeline is initialized correctly. It will for example: Check out the GitHub repository Set up the overall pipeline configuration and perform basic checks Identify which pipeline stages to execute based on the configuration and file patterns Perform automatic versioning of the software artifact in case the master branch pipeline is executed. You find details about this stage on Init Stage Details Pull-Request Voting \u00b6 This stage is responsible for validating pull-requests, see also above. You find further details about this stage on the page Pull-Request Voting . Build \u00b6 In this stage the build of the software artifact is performed. The build artifact will be stash ed for use in subsequent stages. For Docker builds the build result will be uploaded to a container registry (as per your configuration).

Description \u00b6 The Addon Product Modelling is read from the addonDescriptorFileName (e.g. addon.yml). A connection to AAKaaS (Addon Assembly Kit as a Service) is established and the Addon Product Modelling is transfered for detailed checks . The semantic versions are resolved and stored into the piper commonPipelineEnviroment for usage in subsequent pipeline steps. For logon to AAKaaS you can either provide a credential with basic authorization (username and password) or two secret text credentials containing the technical s-users certificate (see note 2805811 for download) as base64 encoded string and the password to decrypt the file For Terminology refer to the Scenario Description . Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file . In this case, calling the step is essentially reduced to defining the step name. Calling the step can be done either in an orchestrator specific way (e.g. via a Jenkins library step) or on the command line.

The Cloud Foundry parameters (API endpoint, organization, space), credentials, the service instance for the ABAP service and the service key for the Communication Scenario SAP_COM_0582. Only provide one of those options with the respective credentials. If all values are provided, the direct communication (via host) has priority. The step needs information about the packages which should be assembled present in the CommonPipelineEnvironment. For each repository/component version it needs the name of the repository, the version, splevel, patchlevel, namespace, packagename, package type, the status of the package, and optional the predecessor commit id. To upload this information to the CommonPipelineEnvironment run prior to this step the steps: abapAddonAssemblyKitCheckCVs , abapAddonAssemblyKitReserveNextPackages . If one of the package is already in status released, the assembly for this package will not be executed. The Software Components for which packages are to be assembled need to be present in the system. This can be done manually through the respective applications on the SAP BTP, ABAP environment system.

For every assembled package an respective zip archive with its related logs are created and archived as artifact. Prerequisites \u00b6 A SAP BTP, ABAP environment system is available. This can be created manually on Cloud Foundry. In a pipeline, you can do this, for example, with the step cloudFoundryCreateService . Communication Scenario \u201cSAP BTP, ABAP Environment - Software Assembly Integration (SAP_COM_0582)\u201c is setup for this system. E.g. a Communication User , a Communication System and a Communication Arrangement are configured. This can be done manually through the respective applications on the SAP BTP, ABAP environment system, or through creating a service key for the system on cloud foundry with the parameters {\u201cscenario_id\u201d: \u201cSAP_COM_0582\", \u201ctype\u201d: \u201cbasic\u201d}. In a pipeline, you can do this, for example, with the step cloudFoundryCreateServiceKey . You have following options to provide the ABAP endpoint configuration: The host and credentials the SAP BTP, ABAP environment system itself. The credentials must be configured for the Communication Scenario SAP_COM_0582. The Cloud Foundry parameters (API endpoint, organization, space), credentials, the service instance for the ABAP service and the service key for the Communication Scenario SAP_COM_0582. Only provide one of those options with the respective credentials. If all values are provided, the direct communication (via host) has priority. The step needs information about the packages which should be assembled present in the CommonPipelineEnvironment. For each repository/component version it needs the name of the repository, the version, splevel, patchlevel, namespace, packagename, package type, the status of the package, and optional the predecessor commit id. To upload this information to the CommonPipelineEnvironment run prior to this step the steps: abapAddonAssemblyKitCheckCVs , abapAddonAssemblyKitReserveNextPackages . If one of the package is already in status released, the assembly for this package will not be executed. The Software Components for which packages are to be assembled need to be present in the system. This can be done manually through the respective applications on the SAP BTP, ABAP environment system. In a pipeline, you can do this, for example, with the step abapEnvironmentPullGitRepo . In case multiple software component are used, any dependencies between the components need to be defined in Software Component Relations . The packages to be assembled need to be reserved in AAKaaS and the corresponding information needs to be present in CommonPipelineEnvironment. To do so run step abapAddonAssemblyKitReserveNextPackages prior this step.

In this case, calling the step in the Jenkinsfile is reduced to one line: abapEnvironmentCheckoutBranch script: this If you want to provide the host and credentials of the Communication Arrangement directly, the configuration could look as follows: steps : abapEnvironmentCheckoutBranch : repositoryName : '/DMO/GIT_REPOSITORY' branchName : 'my-demo-branch' abapCredentialsId : 'abapCredentialsId' host : '1234-abcd-5678-efgh-ijk.abap.eu10.hana.ondemand.com' Please note that the branchName parameter specifies the target branch you want to switch on. Also keep in mind that the repositoryName parameter must define a single repository. Also you can specify a dedicated file, e.g. repositories.yml containing a list of repositories and the respective branches you want to switch on: steps : abapEnvironmentCheckoutBranch : repositories : 'repositories.yml' abapCredentialsId : 'abapCredentialsId' host : '1234-abcd-5678-efgh-ijk.abap.eu10.hana.ondemand.com' The associated config file, e.g. repositories.yml could look as follows: repositories : - name : '/DMO/GIT_REPOSITORY' branch : 'master' - name : '/DMO/GIT_REPO' branch : 'master' Please note that you need to use the YAML data structure as in the example above when using the repositories.yml config file.

In the first example, the host and the credentialsId of the Communication Arrangement are directly provided. abapEnvironmentCloneGitRepo ( script: this , repositoryName: '/DMO/GIT_REPOSITORY' , branchName: 'my-demo-branch' , abapCredentialsId: 'abapCredentialsId' , host: '1234-abcd-5678-efgh-ijk.abap.eu10.hana.ondemand.com' ) In the second example, the host and credentialsId will be read from the provided cloud foundry service key of the specified service instance. abapEnvironmentCloneGitRepo ( script: this , repositoryName: '/DMO/GIT_REPOSITORY' , branchName: 'my-demo-branch' abapCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , cfApiEndpoint: 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg: 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfServiceInstance: 'cfServiceInstance' , cfServiceKeyName: 'cfServiceKeyName' ) Example: Cloning a Bring Your Own Git (BYOG) repository \u00b6 Feature will be available in November 2024. Since a ByoG repository is an external repository, you must be authenticated to clone it. For this, the corresponding credentials must be stored in Jenkins as a username and password/token. Store the credentials: A new credential with the type username and password must be stored. Jenkins Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Credentials These credentials are used to clone the ByoG repository. More information on configuring the credentials can be found here . The config.yaml should look like this: steps : abapEnvironmentCloneGitRepo : repositories : 'repos.yaml' byogCredentialsId : 'byogCredentialsId' abapCredentialsId : 'abapCredentialsId' host : '1234-abcd-5678-efgh-ijk.abap.eu10.hana.ondemand.com' byogCredentialsId: 'byogCredentialsId' is the reference to the defined credential in Jenkins. So take care that this matches with your setup.

In this case, calling the step in the Jenkinsfile is reduced to one line: abapEnvironmentPushATCSystemConfig script: this If you want to provide the host and credentials of the Communication Arrangement directly, the configuration could look as follows: steps : abapEnvironmentPushATCSystemConfig : abapCredentialsId : 'abapCredentialsId' , host : 'https://myABAPendpoint.com' , atcSystemConfigFilePath : 'atcSystemConfig.json' , To trigger a create/update ATC System Configuration step an ATC System configuration file atcSystemConfig.json will be needed. Check section 'ATC System Configuration file example' for more information. Create/Update an ATC System Configuration via Cloud Foundry Service Key example in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 The following example triggers a Create/Update operation on an ATC System Configuration via reading the Service Key of an ABAP instance in Cloud Foundry. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the cfCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to Cloud Foundry. The username and password to authenticate to ABAP system will then be read from the Cloud Foundry service key that is bound to the ABAP instance. This can be done accordingly: abapEnvironmentPushATCSystemConfig ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfServiceInstance: 'myServiceInstance' , cfServiceKeyName: 'myServiceKey' , abapCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , atcSystemConfigFilePath: 'atcSystemConfig.json' , script: this , ) Create/Update an ATC System Configuration via direct ABAP endpoint configuration in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 This example triggers a create/update operation on an ATC System Configuration run directly on the ABAP endpoint. In order to trigger the create/update operation on an ATC System Configuration you have to pass the username and password for authentication to the ABAP endpoint via parameters as well as the ABAP endpoint/host. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the abapCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to the ABAP endpoint/host. This must be configured as following: abapEnvironmentPushATCSystemConfig ( abapCredentialsId: 'abapCredentialsId' , host: 'https://myABAPendpoint.com' , atcSystemConfigFilePath: 'atcSystemConfig.json' , script: this , ) To create/update an ATC System Configuration a file atcSystemConfig.json will be needed. Check section 'ATC System configuration file example' for more information. ATC System configuration file example \u00b6 The step always performs a check first, if an ATC System Configuration with the same name provided in the file atcSystemConfig.json with the attribute conf_name. This file contains an JSON Representation of an ATC System Configuration. Some json file examples can be found below. In case an ATC System Configuration with this name already exists, by default, the step would perform an update of this ATC System Configuration with the ATC System Configuration information provided in file atcSystemConfig.json . If this is not desired, an update could be supressed by using the parameter patchIfExisting in the configuration yaml the following way: steps : abapEnvironmentPushATCSystemConfig : atcSystemConfigFilePath : atcSystemConfig.json, patchIfExisting : false, In this case the step skips further processing after existence check and returns with a Warning. Providing a specifc System configuration file atcSystemConfig.json is mandatory. The following section contains an example of an atcSystemConfig.json file. This file must be stored in the same Git folder where the Jenkinsfile is stored to run the pipeline. This folder must be taken as a SCM in the Jenkins pipeline to run the pipeline.

In this case, calling the step in the Jenkinsfile is reduced to one line: abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck script: this If you want to provide the host and credentials of the Communication Arrangement directly, the configuration could look as follows: steps : abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck : abapCredentialsId : 'abapCredentialsId' , host : 'https://myABAPendpoint.com' , atcConfig : 'atcconfig.yml' , ATC run via Cloud Foundry Service Key example in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 The following example triggers an ATC run via reading the Service Key of an ABAP instance in Cloud Foundry. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the cfCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to Cloud Foundry. The username and password to authenticate to ABAP system will then be read from the Cloud Foundry service key that is bound to the ABAP instance. This can be done accordingly: abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfServiceInstance: 'myServiceInstance' , cfServiceKeyName: 'myServiceKey' , abapCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , atcConfig: 'atcconfig.yml' , script: this , ) To trigger the ATC run an ATC config file atcconfig.yml will be needed. Check section 'ATC config file example' for more information. ATC run via direct ABAP endpoint configuration in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 This example triggers an ATC run directly on the ABAP endpoint. In order to trigger the ATC run you have to pass the username and password for authentication to the ABAP endpoint via parameters as well as the ABAP endpoint/host. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the abapCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to the ABAP endpoint/host. This must be configured as following: abapEnvironmentRunATCCheck ( abapCredentialsId: 'abapCredentialsId' , host: 'https://myABAPendpoint.com' , atcConfig: 'atcconfig.yml' , script: this , ) To trigger the ATC run an ATC config file atcconfig.yml will be needed. Check section 'ATC config file example' for more information. ATC config file example \u00b6 Providing a specifc ATC configuration is optional. If you are using a repositories.yml file for the Clone stage of the ABAP environment pipeline, a default ATC configuration will be derived if no explicit ATC configuration is available. The following section contains an example of an atcconfig.yml file. This file must be stored in the same Git folder where the Jenkinsfile is stored to run the pipeline. This folder must be taken as a SCM in the Jenkins pipeline to run the pipeline. You can specify a list of packages and/or software components to be checked. This must be in the same format as below example for a atcconfig.yml file. In case subpackages shall be included in the checks you can use packagetrees. Please note that if you chose to provide both packages and software components to be checked with the atcconfig.yml file, the set of packages and the set of software components will be combinend by the API using a logical AND operation. Therefore, we advise to specify either the software components or packages. Additionally, if you don't specify a dedicated ATC check variant to be used, the ABAP_CLOUD_DEVELOPMENT_DEFAULT variant will be used as default. For more information on how to configure a check variant for an ATC run please check the last example on this page. See below example for an atcconfig.yml file with both packages and software components to be checked: objectset : softwarecomponents : - name : TestComponent - name : TestComponent2 packages : - name : TestPackage packagetrees : - name : TestPackageWithSubpackages The following example of an atcconfig.yml file that only contains packages and packagetrees to be checked: objectset : packages : - name : TestPackage packagetrees : - name : TestPackageWithSubpackages The following example of an atcconfig.yml file that only contains software components to be checked: objectset : softwarecomponents : - name : TestComponent - name : TestComponent2 The following is an example of an atcconfig.yml file that supports the check variant and configuration ATC options and containing the software components TestComponent and TestComponent2 as Objectset. checkvariant : \"TestCheckVariant\" configuration : \"TestConfiguration\" objectset : softwarecomponents : - name : TestComponent - name : TestComponent2 The following example of an atcconfig.yml file contains all possible properties of the Multi Property Set that can be used. Please take note that this is not the reccommended approach. If you want to check packages or software components please use the two above examples.

Please provide either of the following options: The host and credentials of the BTP ABAP Environment system itself. The credentials must be configured for the Communication Scenario SAP_COM_0735. The Cloud Foundry parameters (API endpoint, organization, space), credentials, the service instance for the ABAP service and the service key for the Communication Scenario SAP_COM_0735. Only provide one of those options with the respective credentials. If all values are provided, the direct communication (via host) has priority. Regardless of the option you chose, please make sure to provide the object set containing the objects that you want to be checked analog to the examples listed on this page. Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file . In this case, calling the step is essentially reduced to defining the step name. Calling the step can be done either in an orchestrator specific way (e.g. via a Jenkins library step) or on the command line. Jenkins Command Line library ( 'piper-lib-os' ) abapEnvironmentRunAUnitTest script: this piper abapEnvironmentRunAUnitTest !!! Currently the Object Set configuration is limited to the usage of Multi Property Sets. Please note that other sets besides the Multi Property Set will not be included in the ABAP Unit test runs. You can see an example of the Multi Property Sets with all configurable properties. However, we strongly reccommend to only specify packages and software components like in the first two examples of the section AUnit config file example . Prerequisites \u00b6 A SAP BTP, ABAP environment system is available. On this system, a Communication User , a Communication System and a Communication Arrangement is setup for the Communication Scenario \u201cSAP BTP, ABAP Environment - Software Component Test Integration (SAP_COM_0735)\u201c. This can be done manually through the respective applications on the SAP BTP, ABAP environment system or through creating a Service Key for the system on Cloud Foundry with the parameters {\u201cscenario_id\u201d: \u201cSAP_COM_0735\", \u201ctype\u201d: \u201cbasic\u201d}. In a pipeline, you can do this with the step cloudFoundryCreateServiceKey . You can either provide the ABAP endpoint configuration to directly trigger an AUnit run on the ABAP system or optionally provide the Cloud Foundry parameters with your credentials to read a Service Key of a SAP BTP, ABAP environment system in Cloud Foundry that contains all the details of the ABAP endpoint to trigger an AUnit run. Regardless if you chose an ABAP endpoint directly or reading a Cloud Foundry Service Key, you have to provide the object set containing the objects you want to be checked in an AUnit run in a .yml or .yaml file. This file must be stored in the same folder as the Jenkinsfile defining the pipeline. Make sure that the objects contained in the object set are present in the configured system in order to run the check. Please make sure that you have created or pulled the respective software components and/or packages including the test classes and objects in the SAP BTP, ABAP environment system, that should be checked.

In order to trigger the AUnit test run you have to pass the username and password for authentication to the ABAP endpoint via parameters as well as the ABAP endpoint/host. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the abapCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to the ABAP endpoint/host. This must be configured as following: abapEnvironmentRunAUnitTest ( abapCredentialsId: 'abapCredentialsId' , host: 'https://myABAPendpoint.com' , aUnitConfig: 'aUnitConfig.yml' , script: this , ) To trigger the AUnit test run an AUnit config file aUnitConfig.yml will be needed. Check the section 'AUnit config file example' for more information. AUnit test run via Cloud Foundry Service Key example in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 The following example triggers an AUnit test run via reading the Service Key of an ABAP instance in Cloud Foundry. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the cfCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to Cloud Foundry. The username and password to authenticate to ABAP system will then be read from the Cloud Foundry Service Key that is bound to the ABAP instance. This can be done accordingly: abapEnvironmentRunAUnitTest ( cfApiEndpoint: 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg: 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfServiceInstance: 'myServiceInstance' , cfServiceKeyName: 'myServiceKey' , abapCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , aUnitConfig: 'aUnitConfig.yml' , script: this , ) To trigger the AUnit test run an AUnit config file aUnitConfig.yml will be needed. Check the section 'AUnit config file example' for more information. AUnit test run via direct ABAP endpoint configuration in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 This example triggers an AUnit run directly on the ABAP endpoint. In order to trigger the AUnit run you have to pass the username and password for authentication to the ABAP endpoint via parameters as well as the ABAP endpoint/host. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the abapCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to the ABAP endpoint/host. This must be configured as following: abapEnvironmentRunAUnitTest ( abapCredentialsId: 'abapCredentialsId' , host: 'https://myABAPendpoint.com' , aUnitConfig: 'aUnitConfig.yml' , script: this , ) To trigger the AUnit run an AUnit config file aUnitConfig.yml will be needed. Check section 'AUnit config file example' for more information. AUnit config file example \u00b6 Providing a specifc AUnit configuration is optional. If you are using a repositories.yml file for the Clone stage of the ABAP environment pipeline, a default AUnit configuration will be derived if no explicit AUnit configuration is available. The following section contains an example of an aUnitConfig.yml file. This file must be stored in the same Git folder where the Jenkinsfile is stored to run the pipeline. This repository containing the Jenkinsfile must be taken as a SCM in the Jenkins pipeline to run the pipeline. You can specify a Multi Property Set containing multiple properties that should be checked. Each property that is specified in the Multi Property Set acts like an additional rule. This means if you specify e.g. a Multi Property Set containing the owner and package properties that an ABAP Unit test run will be started testing all objects belonging to this owner inside of the given package. If you additionally define the Version to be ACTIVE for the ABAP Unit test run inside of the Multi Property Set, only objects belonging to this owner which are active inside of the package would be tested. This must be in the same format as below examples for a aUnitConfig.yml file. Note that if you want to check complete software components we recommend to use the softwareComponent property over the package property. See below example for an aUnitConfig.yml file containing a minimal configuration for the software component /DMO/SWC to be checked: title : My AUnit run context : My unit tests objectset : softwarecomponents : - name : /DMO/SWC See below example for an aUnitConfig.yml file with the configured options containing the package Z_TEST_PACKAGE to be checked: title : My AUnit run context : My unit tests objectset : packages : - name : Z_TEST_PACKAGE The following example of an aUnitConfig.yml file containing the software component Z_TESTSC and shows the available options: title : My AUnit run context : My unit tests options : measurements : none scope : ownTests : true foreignTests : true riskLevel : harmless : true dangerous : true critical : true duration : short : true medium : true long : true objectset : softwarecomponents : - name : Z_TESTSC The following example of an aUnitConfig.yml file contains all possible properties of the Multi Property Set that can be used.

If you are using a repositories.yml file for the Clone stage of the ABAP environment pipeline, a default AUnit configuration will be derived if no explicit AUnit configuration is available. The following section contains an example of an aUnitConfig.yml file. This file must be stored in the same Git folder where the Jenkinsfile is stored to run the pipeline. This repository containing the Jenkinsfile must be taken as a SCM in the Jenkins pipeline to run the pipeline. You can specify a Multi Property Set containing multiple properties that should be checked. Each property that is specified in the Multi Property Set acts like an additional rule. This means if you specify e.g. a Multi Property Set containing the owner and package properties that an ABAP Unit test run will be started testing all objects belonging to this owner inside of the given package. If you additionally define the Version to be ACTIVE for the ABAP Unit test run inside of the Multi Property Set, only objects belonging to this owner which are active inside of the package would be tested. This must be in the same format as below examples for a aUnitConfig.yml file. Note that if you want to check complete software components we recommend to use the softwareComponent property over the package property. See below example for an aUnitConfig.yml file containing a minimal configuration for the software component /DMO/SWC to be checked: title : My AUnit run context : My unit tests objectset : softwarecomponents : - name : /DMO/SWC See below example for an aUnitConfig.yml file with the configured options containing the package Z_TEST_PACKAGE to be checked: title : My AUnit run context : My unit tests objectset : packages : - name : Z_TEST_PACKAGE The following example of an aUnitConfig.yml file containing the software component Z_TESTSC and shows the available options: title : My AUnit run context : My unit tests options : measurements : none scope : ownTests : true foreignTests : true riskLevel : harmless : true dangerous : true critical : true duration : short : true medium : true long : true objectset : softwarecomponents : - name : Z_TESTSC The following example of an aUnitConfig.yml file contains all possible properties of the Multi Property Set that can be used. Please take note that this is not the reccommended approach. If you want to check packages or software components please use the two above examples.

Description \u00b6 Prepares and potentially updates the artifact's version before building the artifact. The continuous delivery process requires that each build is done with a unique version number. There are two common patterns found: 1. Continuous Deployment pattern with automatic versioning \u00b6 The team has full authority on <major>.<minor>.<patch> and can increase any part whenever required. Nonetheless, the automatic versioning makes sure that every build will create a unique version by appending <major>.<minor>.<patch> with a buildversion (we use a timestamp) and optionally the commitId. In order to represent this version also in the version control system the new unique version will be pushed with a dedicated tag ( <tagPrefix><major>.<minor>.<patch><unique extension> ). Depending on the build tool used and thus the allowed versioning format the <unique extension> varies. Remarks: There is no commit to master since this would create a perpetuum mobile and just trigger the next automatic build with automatic versioning, and so on ... Not creating a tag would lead to a loss of the final artifact version in scm which often is not acceptable You need to ensure that your CI/CD system can push back to your SCM (via providing ssh or HTTP(s) credentials) This pattern is the default behavior ( versioningType: cloud ) since this is suitable for most cloud deliveries. It is possible to use versioningType: cloud_noTag which has a slightly different behavior than described above: The new version will NOT be written as tag into the SCM but it is only available in the corresponding CI/CD workspace IMPORTANT NOTICE: Using the option cloud_noTag should not be picked in case you need to ensure a fully traceable path from SCM commit to your build artifact. 2. Pure version <major>.<minor>.<patch> \u00b6 This pattern is often used by teams that have cloud deliveries with no fully automated procedure, e.g. delivery after each takt. Another typical use-case is development of a library with regular releases where the versioning pattern should be consumable and thus ideally complies to a <major>.<minor>.<patch> pattern. The version is then either manually set by the team in the course of the development process or automatically pushed to master after a successful release. Unlike for the Continuous Deloyment pattern described above, in this case there is no dedicated tagging required for the build process since the version is already available in the repository. Configuration of this pattern is done via versioningType: library . Support of additional build tools \u00b6 Besides the buildTools provided out of the box (like maven , mta , npm , ...) it is possible to set buildTool: custom . This allows you to provide automatic versioning for tools using a: file with the version as only content: \u00b6 Define buildTool: custom as well as filePath: <path to your file> Please note: <path to your file> need to point either to a *.txt file or to a file without extension. Warning: Using a plain version file may lead to issues in later pipeline steps, as some steps expect structured files (ini, yaml, json) for version extraction. ini file containing the version: \u00b6 Define buildTool: custom , filePath: <path to your ini-file> as well as parameters customVersionSection and customVersionField to point to the version location (section & parameter name) within the file. Please note: <path to your file> need to point either to a *.cfg or a *.ini file. json file containing the version: \u00b6 Define buildTool: custom , filePath: <path to your *.json file> as well as parameter customVersionField to point to the parameter containing the version. yaml file containing the version \u00b6 Define buildTool: custom , filePath: <path to your *.yml/*.yaml file> as well as parameter customVersionField to point to the parameter containing the version.

For each entry in additionalTargetTools a dedicated entry has to be maintained. You can use either a file name or a glob pattern like **/package.json .

Nonetheless, the automatic versioning makes sure that every build will create a unique version by appending <major>.<minor>.<patch> with a buildversion (we use a timestamp) and optionally the commitId. In order to represent this version also in the version control system the new unique version will be pushed with a dedicated tag ( <tagPrefix><major>.<minor>.<patch><unique extension> ). Depending on the build tool used and thus the allowed versioning format the <unique extension> varies. Remarks: There is no commit to master since this would create a perpetuum mobile and just trigger the next automatic build with automatic versioning, and so on ... Not creating a tag would lead to a loss of the final artifact version in scm which often is not acceptable You need to ensure that your CI/CD system can push back to your SCM (via providing ssh or HTTP(s) credentials) This pattern is the default behavior ( versioningType: cloud ) since this is suitable for most cloud deliveries. It is possible to use versioningType: cloud_noTag which has a slightly different behavior than described above: The new version will NOT be written as tag into the SCM but it is only available in the corresponding CI/CD workspace IMPORTANT NOTICE: Using the option cloud_noTag should not be picked in case you need to ensure a fully traceable path from SCM commit to your build artifact.","title":"1.

The version is then either manually set by the team in the course of the development process or automatically pushed to master after a successful release.

See How do I create and activate a new AWS account? for details. You will need AWS access keys for your S3 Bucket. Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS. You can create them by using the AWS Management Console. The access keys must allow the action \"s3:PutObject\" for the specified S3 Bucket Set up the AWS Credentials \u00b6 To make your AWS credentials available to the jenkins library, store them as Jenkins credentials of type \"Secret Text\". The \"Secret Text\" must be in JSON format and contain the \"access_key_id\", \"secret_access_key\", \"bucket\" as well as the \"region\". For Example: { \"access_key_id\" : \"FJNAKNCLAVLRNBLAVVBK\" , \"bucket\" : \"vro-artloarj-ltnl-nnbv-ibnh-lbnlsnblltbn\" , \"secret_access_key\" : \"123467895896646438486316436kmdlcvreanvjk\" , \"region\" : \"eu-central-1\" } If the JSON string contains additional information, this is not a problem. These are automatically detected and skipped. About Files/Directories to Upload \u00b6 With the step awsS3Upload you can upload single files as well as whole directories into your S3 bucket.

This follows the behavior of cf push --vars-file , and can be used as a pre-deployment step if commands other than cf push are used for deployment (e.g. cf blue-green-deploy ). The format to reference a variable in the manifest YAML file is to use double parentheses (( and )) , e.g. ((variableName)) . You can declare variable assignments as key value-pairs inside a YAML variables file following the Cloud Foundry standards format. Optionally, you can also specify a direct list of key-value mappings for variables using the manifestVariables parameter. Variables given in the manifestVariables list will take precedence over those found in variables files. This follows the behavior of cf push --var , and works in combination with manifestVariablesFiles . The step is activated by the presence of the file specified by the manifestFile parameter and all variables files specified by the manifestVariablesFiles parameter, or if variables are passed in directly via manifestVariables . In case no manifestVariablesFiles were explicitly specified, a default named manifest-variables.yml will be looked for and if present will activate this step also. This is to support convention over configuration. Parameters \u00b6 name mandatory default possible values manifestFile no manifestVariables no manifestVariablesFiles no outputManifestFile no script yes manifestFile - The String path of the Yaml file to replace variables in. Defaults to \"manifest.yml\" if not specified otherwise. manifestVariables - A List of Map entries for key-value pairs used for variable substitution within the file given by manifestFile . Defaults to an empty list, if not specified otherwise. This can be used to set variables like it is provided by cf push --var key=value . The order of the maps of variables given in the list is relevant in case there are conflicting variable names and values between maps contained within the list. In case of conflicts, the last specified map in the list will win. Though each map entry in the list can contain more than one key-value pair for variable substitution, it is recommended to stick to one entry per map, and rather declare more maps within the list. The reason is that if a map in the list contains more than one key-value entry, and the entries are conflicting, the conflict resolution behavior is undefined (since map entries have no sequence). Note: variables defined via manifestVariables always win over conflicting variables defined via any file given by manifestVariablesFiles - no matter what is declared before. This reproduces the same behavior as can be observed when using cf push --var in combination with cf push --vars-file . manifestVariablesFiles - The List of String paths of the Yaml files containing the variable values to use as a replacement in the manifest file. Defaults to [\"manifest-variables.yml\"] if not specified otherwise. The order of the files given in the list is relevant in case there are conflicting variable names and values within variable files. In such a case, the values of the last file win. outputManifestFile - The String path of the Yaml file to produce as output. If not specified this will default to manifestFile and overwrite it. script - The common script environment of the Jenkinsfile running.

Side effects \u00b6 Unless configured otherwise, this step will replace the input manifest.yml with a version that has all variable references replaced. This alters the source tree in your Jenkins workspace. If you prefer to generate a separate output file, use the step's outputManifestFile parameter. Keep in mind, however, that your Cloud Foundry deployment step should then also reference this output file - otherwise CF deployment will fail with unresolved variable reference errors. Exceptions \u00b6 org.yaml.snakeyaml.scanner.ScannerException - in case any of the loaded input files contains malformed Yaml and cannot be parsed. hudson.AbortException - in case of internal errors and when not all variables could be replaced due to missing replacement values.

Description \u00b6 Checkmarx is a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool to analyze i.e. Java- or TypeScript, Swift, Golang, Ruby code, and many other programming languages for security flaws based on a set of provided rules/queries that can be customized and extended. This step by default enforces a specific audit baseline for findings and therefore ensures that: No 'To Verify' High and Medium issues exist in your project Total number of High and Medium 'Confirmed' or 'Urgent' issues is zero 10% of all Low issues are 'Confirmed' or 'Not Exploitable' You can adapt above thresholds specifically using the provided configuration parameters and i.e. check for absolute thresholds instead of percentage whereas we strongly recommend you to stay with the defaults provided. Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file . In this case, calling the step is essentially reduced to defining the step name.

The list might be incomplete. Consider using the ppiper/jenkins-master docker image. This images comes with preinstalled plugins. QualityGates \u00b6 It is possible to define quality gates to set the build result to FAILURE (not stop the build) on a certain count of findings.

Defaults to an empty list, if not specified otherwise. This can be used to set variables like it is provided by cf push --var key=value . The order of the maps of variables given in the list is relevant in case there are conflicting variable names and values between maps contained within the list. In case of conflicts, the last specified map in the list will win. Though each map entry in the list can contain more than one key-value pair for variable substitution, it is recommended to stick to one entry per map, and rather declare more maps within the list. The reason is that if a map in the list contains more than one key-value entry, and the entries are conflicting, the conflict resolution behavior is undefined (since map entries have no sequence). Variables defined via manifestVariables always win over conflicting variables defined via any file given by manifestVariablesFiles - no matter what is declared before.

It makes use of the cfCreateServiceConfig flag for passing a JSON configuration as an in-line parameter string as well as the cfServiceTags for providing user tags. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the cfCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to Cloud Foundry. This can be done accordingly: cloudFoundryCreateService ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , cfService: 'myService' , cfServiceInstanceName: 'myServiceInstanceName' , cfServicePlan: 'myPlan' , cfCreateServiceConfig: '{\\\"example\\\":\\\"value\\\",\\\"example\\\":\\\"value\\\"}' , cfServiceTags: 'list, of, tags' , script: this , ) If you chose to having a dedicated JSON file for the JSON configuration for the cfCreateServiceConfig flag you can do so by referencing the file path accordingly. This file should be stored in the same folder as your Jenkinsfile that starts the Pipeline in order for the Pipeline to be able to find the file. Most favourable SCM is Git. Such a JSON file with the appropriate step configuration could look as follows: The JSON config file, e.g. createServiceConfig.json can look like this: { \"example\" : \"value\" , \"example\" : \"value\" } The step configuration needs to contain the path to the JSON file: cloudFoundryCreateService ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , cfService: 'myService' , cfServiceInstanceName: 'myServiceInstanceName' , cfServicePlan: 'myPlan' , cfCreateServiceConfig: 'createServiceConfig.json' , cfServiceTags: 'list, of, tags' , script: this , ) Multiple Service Creation in Cloud Foundry example with manifest file in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 The following example shows the option to create multiple Services in Cloud Foundry. It makes use of the Cloud Foundry Create-Service-Push Plugin. This is described in above Prerequisites, please check this section for further information regarding its usage. This plugin enables this step to create multiple Cloud Foundry Services in one step. It requires a dedicated YAML file, e.g. manifest.yml , that contains all the information for creating the services, including their names, service plan and the service broker. Such a manifest.yml file needs to have the following structure, e.g. for creating three mongoDB Services with the Service Plan v4.0-dev: --- create-services : - name : \"testDatabase1\" broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : \"testDatabase2\" broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : \"testDatabase3\" broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" The path of the manifest.yml config file needs to be passed as a parameter in the serviceManifest flag. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the cfCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to Cloud Foundry. This can be done accordingly: cloudFoundryCreateService ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , serviceManifest: 'manifest.yml' , script: this , ) Multiple Service Creation in Cloud Foundry example with manifest file and variable substitution in Jenkinsfile \u00b6 Additionally the Cloud Foundry Create-Service-Push Plugin offers the option to make use of variable substitution. This enables you to rename variables in the manifest.yml dynamically. It can be done either via providing the file path to a dedicated YAML file containing the information regarding the variable substitution values in the manifestVariablesFiles flag or via providing a String List in the manifestVariables flag. Either ways can be achieved as seen in below examples for creating MongoDB instances. For both ways you need to adapt the manifest.yml file to be relevant for variable substitution. This can be done according to below example: --- create-services : - name : ((name1)) broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : ((name2)) broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" - name : ((name3)) broker : \"mongodb\" plan : \"v4.0-dev\" If you chose to have a dedicated file for the variable substitution values, it needs to have the following structure of the vars.yml file: name1 : test1 name2 : test2 name3 : test3 The path of the manifest.yml config file needs to be passed as a parameter in the serviceManifest flag as well as the path to the vars.yml file in the manifestVariablesFiles flag. You can store the credentials in Jenkins and use the cfCredentialsId parameter to authenticate to Cloud Foundry. This can be done accordingly: cloudFoundryCreateService ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , serviceManifest: 'manifest.yml' , manifestVariablesFiles: 'vars.yml' , script: this , ) You can also pass the values for the variable substition as a string list for the manifestVariables flag. This needs to follow the pattern key=value. This can be done accordingly: cloudFoundryCreateService ( cfApiEndpoint : 'https://test.server.com' , cfOrg : 'cfOrg' , cfSpace: 'cfSpace' , cfCredentialsId: 'cfCredentialsId' , serviceManifest: 'manifest.yml' , manifestVariables: [ \"name1=test1\" , \"name2=test2\" , \"name3=test3\" ], script: this , )","title":"cloudFoundryCreateService"},{"location":"steps/cloudFoundryCreateService/#cloudfoundrycreateservice","text":"Creates one or multiple Services in Cloud Foundry","title":"cloudFoundryCreateService"},{"location":"steps/cloudFoundryCreateService/#description","text":"Creates one or multiple Cloud Foundry Services in Cloud Foundry Mandatory: * Cloud Foundry API endpoint, Organization, Space and user are available Please provide either of the following options: * If you chose to create a single Service the Service Instance Name, Service Plan and Service Broker of the Service to be created have to be available.

It requires a dedicated YAML file, e.g. manifest.yml , that contains all the information for creating the services, including their names, service plan and the service broker.

For rolling deployment strategy , set parameter cfNativeDeployParameters:'--strategy rolling' With MTA CF CLI Plugin for MTA applications The Multiapps Plugin offers 2 different strategies: Blue-Green Deployment Strategy - where the production environments are called \u201clive\u201d and \u201cidle\u201d during deployment. This strategy is activated with mtaDeployParameters: --strategy blue-green --skip-testing-phase and deployType=standard .

Activated by deployType=blue-green . After deployment, appnames are appeneded by suffix like -blue or -green Following table summarizes the different combinations of the step parameters deployType and deployTool and their impact. Parameter buildTool is used to differentiate between MTA and Non MTA applications. If buildTool is not available in the environment, user will have to provide deployTool explicitly. Deployment Strategy Comparison \u00b6 This table compares deployment strategies for MTA and Non-MTA applications. deployType MTA Applications Non MTA Applications standard deployTool = mtaDeployPlugin Uses MTA plugin, Command run cf deploy deployTool = cf_native cf CLI used Command cf push Requires Manifest file and app name appname can be provided via config or manifest file. blue-green deployTool = mtaDeployPlugin, Uses MTA plugin Command run cf deploy bgdeploy Deprecated. Alternative: Rolling deployment strategy by setting cfNativeDeployParameters = '--strategy rolling' deployDockerImage not supported deployDockerImage supported Docker credentials can only be provided as Jenkins environment variable. !!! note Due to an incompatible change in the Cloud Foundry CLI, multiple buildpacks are not supported by this step. If your application contains a list of buildpacks instead of a single buildpack , this will be automatically re-written by the step when blue-green deployment is used. Cloud Foundry supports the deployment of multiple applications using a single manifest file. This option is supported with project \"Piper\". In this case, define appName: '' since the app name for the individual applications has to be defined via the manifest. You can find details in the Cloud Foundry Documentation Recommended way to do docker image deployments is via kubernetesDeploy Piper step.This step is not capable of deploying docker images built in the same pipeline using other piper steps[i.e., kanikoExecute].

Note By default, Black Duck scans run in 'FULL' mode.

Running rapid scans on pull requests \u00b6 If you have configured your orchestrator to detect pull requests, then the detecExecuationScan step in the Piper pipeline can recognize this and change the Black Duck scan mode from 'FULL' to 'RAPID'.

Map with the properties names as key and the corresponding value as value. The value can also be a nested structure. The properties will be added to the pod spec inside node spec at the same level like e.g. containers for eg., additionalPodProperties: [ imagePullSecrets: ['secret-name'] ] This property provides some kind of an expert mode. Any property which is not handled otherwise by the step can be set. It is not possible to overwrite e.g. the containers property or to overwrite the securityContext property. Alternate way for providing additionalPodProperties is via general/jenkinsKubernetes/additionalPodProperties in the project configuration. Providing the resources map as parameter to the step call takes precedence. This freedom comes with great responsibility. The property additionalPodProperties should only be used in case you really know what you are doing. annotations - Adds annotations in the metadata section of the PodSpec containerCommand - Allows to specify start command for container created with dockerImage parameter to overwrite Piper default ( /usr/bin/tail -f /dev/null ). containerCommands - Specifies start command for containers to overwrite Piper default ( /usr/bin/tail -f /dev/null ). If container's defaultstart command should be used provide empty string like: ['selenium/standalone-chrome': ''] . containerEnvVars - Specifies environment variables per container. If not provided dockerEnvVars will be used. containerMap - A map of docker image to the name of the container. The pod will be created with all the images from this map and they are labelled based on the value field of each map entry. Example: ['maven:3.5-jdk-8-alpine': 'mavenExecute', 'selenium/standalone-chrome': 'selenium', 'famiko/jmeter-base': 'checkJMeter', 'ppiper/cf-cli:6': 'cloudfoundry'] containerMountPath - The path to which a volume should be mounted to. This volume will be available at the same mount path in each container of the provided containerMap. The volume is of type emptyDir and has the name 'volume'. With the additionalPodProperties parameter one can for example use this volume in an initContainer. containerName - Optional configuration in combination with containerMap to define the container where the commands should be executed in. containerPortMappings - Map which defines per docker image the port mappings, e.g. containerPortMappings: ['selenium/standalone-chrome': [[name: 'selPort', containerPort: 4444, hostPort: 4444]]] . containerPullImageFlags - Specifies the pullImage flag per container. containerShell - Allows to specify the shell to be executed for container with containerName. containerWorkspaces - Specifies a dedicated user home directory per container which will be passed as value for environment variable HOME . If not provided dockerWorkspace will be used. dockerEnvVars - Environment variables to set in the container, e.g. [http_proxy:'proxy:8080']. dockerImage - Optional name of the docker image that should be used. If no docker image is provided, the closure will be executed in the jnlp agent container. dockerPullImage - Set this to 'false' to bypass a docker image pull. Useful during development process. Allows testing of images which are available in the local registry only. dockerWorkspace - Specifies a dedicated user home directory for the container which will be passed as value for environment variable HOME . initContainerCommand - Command executed inside the init container shell. Please enter command without providing any \"sh -c\" prefix. For example for an echo message, simply enter: echo HelloWorld initContainerImage - The docker image to run as initContainer. jenkinsKubernetes/inheritFrom - Name of the pod template that should be inherited from. The pod template can be defined in the Jenkins UI jenkinsKubernetes/jnlpAgent - Jnlp agent Docker images which should be used to create new pods. jenkinsKubernetes/namespace - Namespace that should be used to create a new pod nodeSelector - Defines the Kubernetes nodeSelector as per https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin . resources - A map containing the resources per container. The key is the container name. The value is a map defining valid resources. An entry with key DEFAULT can be used for defining resources for all containers which does not have resources specified otherwise. Alternate way for providing resources is via general/jenkinsKubernetes/resources in the project configuration. Providing the resources map as parameter to the step call takes precedence. script - The common script environment of the Jenkinsfile running. Typically the reference to the script calling the pipeline step is provided with the this parameter, as in script: this . This allows the function to access the commonPipelineEnvironment for retrieving, e.g. configuration parameters. securityContext - Kubernetes Security Context used for the pod. Can be used to specify uid and fsGroup. See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ sidecarEnvVars - as dockerEnvVars for the sidecar container sidecarImage - as dockerImage for the sidecar container sidecarName - SideCar only: Name of the container in local network. sidecarPullImage - Set this to 'false' to bypass a docker image pull. Useful during development process. Allows testing of images which are available in the local registry only. sidecarReadyCommand - Command executed inside the container which returns exit code 0 when the container is ready to be used. sidecarWorkspace - as dockerWorkspace for the sidecar container stashContent - Specific stashes that should be considered for the step execution. stashExcludes - In the Kubernetes case the workspace is only available to the respective Jenkins slave but not to the containers running inside the pod. This configuration defines exclude pattern for stashing from Jenkins workspace to working directory in container and back.

Map with the properties names as key and the corresponding value as value. The value can also be a nested structure. The properties will be added to the pod spec inside node spec at the same level like e.g. containers for eg., additionalPodProperties: [ imagePullSecrets: ['secret-name'] ] This property provides some kind of an expert mode. Any property which is not handled otherwise by the step can be set. It is not possible to overwrite e.g. the containers property or to overwrite the securityContext property. Alternate way for providing additionalPodProperties is via general/jenkinsKubernetes/additionalPodProperties in the project configuration. Providing the resources map as parameter to the step call takes precedence. This freedom comes with great responsibility. The property additionalPodProperties should only be used in case you really know what you are doing. annotations - Adds annotations in the metadata section of the PodSpec containerCommand - Allows to specify start command for container created with dockerImage parameter to overwrite Piper default ( /usr/bin/tail -f /dev/null ). containerCommands - Specifies start command for containers to overwrite Piper default ( /usr/bin/tail -f /dev/null ). If container's defaultstart command should be used provide empty string like: ['selenium/standalone-chrome': ''] . containerEnvVars - Specifies environment variables per container. If not provided dockerEnvVars will be used. containerMap - A map of docker image to the name of the container. The pod will be created with all the images from this map and they are labelled based on the value field of each map entry. Example: ['maven:3.5-jdk-8-alpine': 'mavenExecute', 'selenium/standalone-chrome': 'selenium', 'famiko/jmeter-base': 'checkJMeter', 'ppiper/cf-cli:6': 'cloudfoundry'] containerMountPath - The path to which a volume should be mounted to. This volume will be available at the same mount path in each container of the provided containerMap. The volume is of type emptyDir and has the name 'volume'. With the additionalPodProperties parameter one can for example use this volume in an initContainer. containerName - Optional configuration in combination with containerMap to define the container where the commands should be executed in. containerPortMappings - Map which defines per docker image the port mappings, e.g. containerPortMappings: ['selenium/standalone-chrome': [[name: 'selPort', containerPort: 4444, hostPort: 4444]]] . containerPullImageFlags - Specifies the pullImage flag per container. containerShell - Allows to specify the shell to be executed for container with containerName. containerWorkspaces - Specifies a dedicated user home directory per container which will be passed as value for environment variable HOME . If not provided dockerWorkspace will be used. dockerEnvVars - Environment variables to set in the container, e.g. [http_proxy:'proxy:8080']. dockerImage - Optional name of the docker image that should be used. If no docker image is provided, the closure will be executed in the jnlp agent container. dockerPullImage - Set this to 'false' to bypass a docker image pull. Useful during development process. Allows testing of images which are available in the local registry only. dockerWorkspace - Specifies a dedicated user home directory for the container which will be passed as value for environment variable HOME . initContainerCommand - Command executed inside the init container shell. Please enter command without providing any \"sh -c\" prefix. For example for an echo message, simply enter: echo HelloWorld initContainerImage - The docker image to run as initContainer. jenkinsKubernetes/inheritFrom - Name of the pod template that should be inherited from. The pod template can be defined in the Jenkins UI jenkinsKubernetes/jnlpAgent - Jnlp agent Docker images which should be used to create new pods. jenkinsKubernetes/namespace - Namespace that should be used to create a new pod nodeSelector - Defines the Kubernetes nodeSelector as per https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin . resources - A map containing the resources per container. The key is the container name. The value is a map defining valid resources. An entry with key DEFAULT can be used for defining resources for all containers which does not have resources specified otherwise. Alternate way for providing resources is via general/jenkinsKubernetes/resources in the project configuration. Providing the resources map as parameter to the step call takes precedence. script - The common script environment of the Jenkinsfile running. Typically the reference to the script calling the pipeline step is provided with the this parameter, as in script: this . This allows the function to access the commonPipelineEnvironment for retrieving, e.g. configuration parameters. securityContext - Kubernetes Security Context used for the pod. Can be used to specify uid and fsGroup. See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ sidecarEnvVars - as dockerEnvVars for the sidecar container sidecarImage - as dockerImage for the sidecar container sidecarName - SideCar only: Name of the container in local network. sidecarPullImage - Set this to 'false' to bypass a docker image pull. Useful during development process. Allows testing of images which are available in the local registry only. sidecarReadyCommand - Command executed inside the container which returns exit code 0 when the container is ready to be used. sidecarWorkspace - as dockerWorkspace for the sidecar container stashContent - Specific stashes that should be considered for the step execution. stashExcludes - In the Kubernetes case the workspace is only available to the respective Jenkins slave but not to the containers running inside the pod. This configuration defines exclude pattern for stashing from Jenkins workspace to working directory in container and back. Following excludes can be set: * workspace : Pattern for stashing towards container * stashBack : Pattern for bringing data from container back to Jenkins workspace.

Description \u00b6 This step executes a Fortify scan on the specified project to perform static code analysis and check the source code for security flaws. The Fortify step triggers a scan locally on your Jenkins within a docker container so finally you have to supply a docker image with a Fortify SCA and Java plus Maven / Gradle or alternatively Python installed into it for being able to perform any scans. Scanning MTA projects Build type maven requires a so called aggregator pom which includes all modules to be scanned. If used in a mta-project which includes non-java submodules as maven dependency (e.g. node via frontend-maven-plugin), exclude those by specifying java path explicitly, e.g. java/**/src/main/java/**/* . Besides triggering a scan the step verifies the results after they have been uploaded and processed by the Fortify SSC. By default the following KPIs are enforced: * All issues must be audited from the Corporate Security Requirements folder. * All issues must be audited from the Audit All folder. * At least one issue per category must be audited from the Spot Checks of Each Category folder. * Nothing needs to be audited from the Optional folder. Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file . In this case, calling the step is essentially reduced to defining the step name.

Using Gauge it is possible to write test specifications in Markdown syntax and therefore allow e.g. product owners to write the relevant acceptance test specifications. At the same time it allows the developer to implement the steps described in the specification in her development environment. You can use the sample projects of Gauge. Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file . In this case, calling the step is essentially reduced to defining the step name.

Description \u00b6 This step executes ABAP unit test and ATC checks for a specified scope of objects that exist in a local Git repository on an ABAP system. Depending on your use case, you can specify a scope of objects for which you want to execute the checks. In addition, you can choose whether you want to execute only ABAP units tests, or only ATC checks, or both. By default, both checks are executed. The results of the checks are stored in a Checkstyle format. With the help of the Jenkins Warnings-Next-Generation Plugin), you can view the issues found, and navigate to the exact line of the source code where the issue occurred. To make the findings visible in the Jenkins plug-in, you need to use the recordIssues step, as displayed in the Example section below. You can use this step as of SAP S/4HANA 2020 with SAP Note 3159798 implemented. Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file .

How to setup this monitoring is described in the following. You basically need three components: The InfluxDB Jenkins plugin which allows you to send build metrics to InfluxDB servers The InfluxDB to store this data (Docker available) A Grafana dashboard to visualize the data stored in InfluxDB (Docker available) no InfluxDB available? If you don't have an InfluxDB available yet this step will still provide you some benefit. It will create following files for you and archive them into your build: jenkins_data.json : This file gives you build-specific information, like e.g. build result, stage where the build failed influx_data.json : This file gives you detailed information about your pipeline, e.g. stage durations, steps executed, ... Prerequisites \u00b6 Setting up InfluxDB with Grafana \u00b6 The easiest way to start with is using the available official docker images. You can either run these docker containers on the same host on which you run your Jenkins or each docker on individual VMs (hosts). Very basic setup can be done like that (with user \"admin\" and password \"adminPwd\" for both InfluxDB and Grafana): docker run -d -p 8083:8083 -p 8086:8086 --restart=always --name influxdb -v /var/influx_data:/var/lib/influxdb influxdb docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name grafana --restart=always --link influxdb:influxdb -e \"GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminPwd\" grafana/grafana For more advanced setup please reach out to the respective documentation: InfluxDB ( Docker Hub GitHub ) Grafana ( Docker Hub GitHub ) After you have started your InfluxDB docker you need to create a database: in a Webbrowser open the InfluxDB Web-UI using the following URL: <host of your docker>:8083 (port 8083 is used for access via Web-UI, for Jenkins you use port 8086 to access the DB) create new DB (the name of this DB you need to provide later to Jenkins) create Admin user (this user you need to provide later to Jenkins) With InfluxDB version 1.1 the InfluxDB Web-UI is deprecated You can perform the above steps via commandline: The following command will create a database with name <databasename> curl -i -XPOST http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode \"q=CREATE DATABASE \\<databasename\\>\" The admin user with the name <adminusername> and the password <adminuserpwd> can be created with curl -i -XPOST http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode \"q=CREATE USER \\<adminusername\\> WITH PASSWORD '\\<adminuserpwd\\>' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES\" Once you have started both docker containers and Influx and Grafana are running you need to configure the Jenkins Plugin according to your settings. Pipeline configuration \u00b6 To setup your Jenkins you need to do two configuration steps: Configure Jenkins (via Manage Jenkins) Adapt pipeline configuration Configure Jenkins \u00b6 Once the plugin is available in your Jenkins: go to \"Manage Jenkins\" > \"Configure System\" > scroll down to section \"influxdb target\" maintain Influx data Jenkins as a Service For Jenkins as a Service instances this is already preset to the local InfluxDB with the name jenkins . In this case there is not need to do any additional configuration. Adapt pipeline configuration \u00b6 You need to define the influxDB server in your pipeline as it is defined in the InfluxDb plugin configuration (see above). influxDBServer = jenkins Parameters \u00b6 name mandatory default possible values artifactVersion no customData no customDataMap no customDataMapTags no customDataTags no influxPrefix no influxServer no `` script yes sonarTokenCredentialsId no wrapInNode no artifactVersion - Defines the version of the current artifact. Defaults to commonPipelineEnvironment.getArtifactVersion() customData - Defines custom data (map of key-value pairs) to be written to Influx into measurement jenkins_custom_data . Defaults to commonPipelineEnvironment.getInfluxCustomData() customDataMap - Defines a map of measurement names containing custom data (map of key-value pairs) to be written to Influx. Defaults to commonPipelineEnvironment.getInfluxCustomDataMap() customDataMapTags - Defines a map of measurement names containing tags (map of key-value pairs) to be written to Influx. Defaults to commonPipelineEnvironment.getInfluxCustomDataTags() customDataTags - Defines tags (map of key-value pairs) to be written to Influx into measurement jenkins_custom_data . Defaults to commonPipelineEnvironment.getInfluxCustomDataTags() influxPrefix - Defines a custom prefix. For example in multi branch pipelines, where every build is named after the branch built and thus you have different builds called 'master' that report different metrics. influxServer - Defines the name of the Influx server as configured in Jenkins global configuration. script - The common script environment of the Jenkinsfile running. Typically the reference to the script calling the pipeline step is provided with the this parameter, as in script: this . This allows the function to access the commonPipelineEnvironment for retrieving, e.g. configuration parameters. sonarTokenCredentialsId - wrapInNode - Defines if a dedicated node/executor should be created in the pipeline run. This is especially relevant when running the step in a declarative POST stage where by default no executor is available. Step configuration \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via config.yml file . In following sections of the config.yml the configuration is possible: parameter general step/stage artifactVersion X customData X customDataMap X customDataMapTags X customDataTags X influxPrefix X influxServer X script sonarTokenCredentialsId X wrapInNode X Dependencies \u00b6 The step depends on the following Jenkins plugins credentials-binding pipeline-utility-steps workflow-basic-steps workflow-cps-global-lib workflow-durable-task-step Transitive dependencies are omitted. The list might be incomplete. Consider using the ppiper/jenkins-master docker image. This images comes with preinstalled plugins. Example \u00b6 influxWriteData script: this Work with InfluxDB and Grafana \u00b6 You can access your Grafana via Web-UI: <host of your grafana(-docker)>:<port3000> (or another port in case you have defined another one when starting your docker) As a first step you need to add your InfluxDB as Data source to your Grafana: Login as user admin (PW as defined when starting your docker) in the navigation go to data sources -> add data source: name type: InfluxDB Url: http://<host of your InfluxDB server>:<port> Access: direct (not via proxy) database: <name of the DB as specified above> User: <name of the admin user as specified in step above> Password: <password of the admin user as specified in step above> Jenkins as a Service For Jenkins as a Service the data source configuration is already available. Therefore no need to go through the data source configuration step unless you want to add additional data sources. Data collected in InfluxDB \u00b6 The Influx plugin collects following data in the project \"Piper\" context: All data as per default InfluxDB plugin capabilities Additional data collected via InfluxData.addField(measurement, key, value) Add custom information to your InfluxDB You can simply add custom data collected during your pipeline runs via available data objects. Example: //add data to measurement jenkins_custom_data - value can be a String or a Number commonPipelineEnvironment . setInfluxCustomDataProperty ( 'myProperty' , 2018 ) Collected InfluxDB measurements \u00b6 Measurements are potentially pre-fixed - see parameter influxPrefix above. Measurement name data column description All measurements build_number project_name All below measurements will have these columns.

Description \u00b6 Executes a Kaniko build for creating a Docker container. Building one container image \u00b6 For building one container image the step expects that one of the containerImage, containerImageName or --destination (via buildOptions) is set. Building multiple container images \u00b6 The step allows you to build multiple container images with one run. This is suitable in case you need to create multiple images for one microservice, e.g. for testing. All images will get the same \"root\" name and the same versioning. Thus, this is not suitable to be used for a monorepo approach! For monorepos you need to use a build tool natively capable to take care for monorepos or implement a custom logic and for example execute this kanikoExecute step multiple times in your custom pipeline. You can activate multiple builds using the parameter containerMultiImageBuild Behavior can be adapted using: containerMultiImageBuildExcludes for defining excludes containerMultiImageBuildTrimDir for removing parent directory part from image name Examples: Multiple containers in sub directories \u00b6 Configuration as follows: general: containerImageName: myImage steps: kanikoExecute: containerMultiImageBuild: true Following Dockerfiles are available in the repository: sub1/Dockerfile sub2/Dockerfile Following final image names will be built: myImage-sub1 myImage-sub2 Multiple containers in sub directories while trimming a directory part \u00b6 Configuration as follows: general: containerImageName: myImage steps: kanikoExecute: containerMultiImageBuild: true containerMultiImageBuildTrimDir: .ci Following Dockerfiles are available in the repository: .ci/sub1/Dockerfile .ci/sub2/Dockerfile Following final image names will be built: myImage-sub1 myImage-sub2 Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file .

Exceptions \u00b6 The step has been migrated into a golang-based step. The following release notes belong to the new implementation: newmanRunCommand : The parameter newmanRunCommand is deprecated by now and is replaced by list parameter runOptions . For backward compatibility, the newmanRunCommand parameter will still be used if configured. Nevertheless, using this parameter can break the step in some cases, e.g. when spaces are used in single quoted strings like spaces in file names. Also Groovy Templating is deprecated and now replaced by Go Templating. The example show the required changes: # deprecated groovy default newmanRunCommand : \"run '${config.newmanCollection}' --environment '${config.newmanEnvironment}' --globals '${config.newmanGlobals}' --reporters junit,html --reporter-junit-export 'target/newman/TEST-${collectionDisplayName}.xml' --reporter-html-export 'target/newman/TEST-${collectionDisplayName}.html'\" # new run options using golang templating runOptions : [ \"run\" , \"{{.NewmanCollection}}\" , \"--environment\" , \"{{.Config.NewmanEnvironment}}\" , \"--globals\" , \"{{.Config.NewmanGlobals}}\" , \"--reporters\" , \"junit,html\" , \"--reporter-junit-export\" , \"target/newman/TEST-{{.CollectionDisplayName}}.xml\" , \"--reporter-html-export\" , \"target/newman/TEST-{{.CollectionDisplayName}}.html\" ] If the following error occurs during the pipeline run, the newmanRunCommand is probably still configured with the deprecated groovy template syntax: info newmanExecute - error: collection could not be loaded info newmanExecute - unable to read data from file \"${config.newmanCollection}\" info newmanExecute - ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '${config.newmanCollection}' newmanEnvironment and newmanGlobals : Referencing newmanEnvironment and newmanGlobals in the runOptions is redundant now. Both parameters are added to runCommand using newmanEnvironment and newmanGlobals from config when configured and not referenced by go templating using \"--environment\", \"{{.Config.NewmanEnvironment}}\" and \"--globals\", \"{{.Config.NewmanGlobals}}\" as shown above. Passing Credentials \u00b6 If you need to pass additional credentials you can do so via environment variables. This is done via templating in the runOptions , as per this example: runOptions : [ \"run\" , \"{{.NewmanCollection}}\" , \"--environment\" , \"{{.Config.NewmanEnvironment}}\" , \"--env-var\" , \"username={{getenv \\\"PIPER_TESTCREDENTIAL_USERNAME\\\"}}\" , \"--env-var\" , \"password={{getenv \\\"PIPER_TESTCREDENTIAL_PASSWORD\\\"}}\" ] Example \u00b6 Pipeline step: newmanExecute script: this This step should be used in combination with testsPublishResults : newmanExecute script: this , failOnError: false testsPublishResults script: this , junit: [ pattern: '**/newman/TEST-*.xml' ]","title":"newmanExecute"},{"location":"steps/newmanExecute/#newmanexecute","text":"Installs newman and executes specified newman collections.

Supports MTA, npm and (multi-module) Maven projects. MTA files will be uploaded to a Maven repository. The uploaded file-type depends on your project structure and step configuration. To upload Maven projects, you need a pom.xml in the project root and set the mavenRepository option. To upload MTA projects, you need a mta.yaml in the project root and set the mavenRepository option. To upload npm projects, you need a package.json in the project root and set the npmRepository option. If the 'format' option is set, the 'URL' can contain the full path including the repository ID. Providing the 'npmRepository' or the 'mavenRepository' parameter(s) is not necessary. npm: Publishing npm projects makes use of npm's \"publish\" command. It requires a \"package.json\" file in the project's root directory which has \"version\" set and is not delared as \"private\". To find out what will be published, run \"npm publish --dry-run\" in the project's root folder. It will use your gitignore file to exclude the mached files from publishing. Note: npm's gitignore parser might yield different results from your git client, to ignore a \"foo\" directory globally use the glob pattern \"**/foo\". If an image for mavenExecute is configured, and npm packages are to be published, the image must have npm installed.

To upload npm projects, you need a package.json in the project root and set the npmRepository option. If the 'format' option is set, the 'URL' can contain the full path including the repository ID. Providing the 'npmRepository' or the 'mavenRepository' parameter(s) is not necessary. npm: Publishing npm projects makes use of npm's \"publish\" command. It requires a \"package.json\" file in the project's root directory which has \"version\" set and is not delared as \"private\". To find out what will be published, run \"npm publish --dry-run\" in the project's root folder. It will use your gitignore file to exclude the mached files from publishing. Note: npm's gitignore parser might yield different results from your git client, to ignore a \"foo\" directory globally use the glob pattern \"**/foo\". If an image for mavenExecute is configured, and npm packages are to be published, the image must have npm installed.","title":"Description"},{"location":"steps/nexusUpload/#usage","text":"We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file .

Description \u00b6 Lock file detection: \u00b6 If package-lock.json is found \u2192 runs npm ci If yarn.lock.json is found \u2192 runs yarn install --frozen-lockfile If pnpm-lock.yaml is found \u2192 runs pnpm install --frozen-lockfile If no lock file is found \u2192 defaults to npm install and continues execution Only the install command uses the detected package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm). All other commands (e.g., run , pack , publish ) are executed via the npm CLI, regardless of which lock file is detected. Rationale: In the Piper environment, using the npm CLI for non-install commands provides sufficient functionality without requiring additional CLI dependencies. Supporting yarn or pnpm for these commands was deemed unnecessary due to lack of added benefit. If your project contains multiple package.json files (i.e., multi module projects), install command will be run in every directory where the package.json file is found. One can use buildDescriptorList or buildDescriptorExcludeList (more details below) to override the default behaviour. pnpm multi-module support: \u00b6 pnpm multi-module projects are supported when each package has its own pnpm-lock.yaml file. Workspace-based pnpm projects are not yet supported. pnpm and running tests. \u00b6 When pnpm is installed, it is placed in ./tmp/node_modules/.bin/pnpm , and some dependency files under ./tmp/ may include test files. If your test runner uses a broad glob pattern (such as **/*.test.js ), it might unintentionally pick up test files from ./tmp/** . To avoid this, exclude ./tmp/** from your test execution patterns. For best results, use more specific glob patterns for running tests, such as src/**/*.test.js , to ensure only your intended test files are executed.

The step spins up a Docker container based on the specified dockerImage and executes the installScript and runScript from package.json . The application URLs and credentials can be specified in appUrls and credentialsId respectively. If wdi5 is set to true , the step uses wdi5_username and wdi5_password for authentication. The tests can be restricted to run only on the productive branch by setting onlyRunInProductiveBranch to true . Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file . In this case, calling the step is essentially reduced to defining the step name.

It can be used to scan docker images but is supports many other programming languages especially those of the C family. Description \u00b6 Black Duck Binary Analysis (previously known as Protecode) is an Open Source Vulnerability Scan tool which provides the composition of Open Source components in a product along with Security information (no license info is provided). BDBA (Protecode) uses a combination of static binary analysis techniques to X-ray the provided software package to identify third-party software components and their exact versions with a high level of confidence. Methods range from simple string matching to proprietary patent-pending techniques. Auditing findings (Triaging) Triaging is now supported by the BDBA (Protecode) backend and also Piper does consider this information during the analysis of the scan results though product versions are not supported by BDBA (Protecode). Therefore please make sure that the fileName you are providing does either contain a stable version or that it does not contain one at all. By ensuring that you are able to triage CVEs globally on the upload file's name without affecting any other artifacts scanned in the same BDBA (Protecode) group and as such triaged vulnerabilities will be considered during the next scan and will not fail the build anymore. Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file . In this case, calling the step is essentially reduced to defining the step name. Calling the step can be done either in an orchestrator specific way (e.g. via a Jenkins library step) or on the command line. Jenkins Command Line library ( 'piper-lib-os' ) protecodeExecuteScan script: this piper protecodeExecuteScan Outputs \u00b6 Output type Details influx measurement step_data protecode measurement protecode_data excluded_vulnerabilities historical_vulnerabilities major_vulnerabilities minor_vulnerabilities triaged_vulnerabilities vulnerabilities Prerequisites \u00b6 Create a Username / Password credential with the Protecode user in your Jenkins credential store Look up your Group ID using REST API via curl -u <username> \"https://<protecode host>/api/groups/\" . If the image is on a protected registry you can provide a Docker config.json file containing the credential information for the registry. You can either use docker login (see the Docker documentation for details) or you can create the file manually using the following script. #!/bin/bash auth = $( echo -n \" $USER : $PASSWORD \" | base64 -w0 ) cat <<EOF > config.json { \"auths\": { \"$REGISTRY\": { \"auth\": \"$auth\" } } } EOF REGISTRY is the URL of the protected registry (Example: https://index.docker.io/v1 ).

Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file . In this case, calling the step is essentially reduced to defining the step name. Calling the step can be done either in an orchestrator specific way (e.g. via a Jenkins library step) or on the command line.

Depending on the size of the repository, this would be quite expensive or not possible at all. Administering the Change Document ID by Git Commit Messages \u00b6 A change document documents activities in the change process. To upload an artifact into a transport request, the Solution Manager expects the ID of an assigned change document. For more information, see transportRequestUploadSOLMAN . transportRequestDocIDFromGit allows you to retrieve the change document ID from the commit message of the Git repository of your project. This way, you can address the change document without having to change the setup of your pipeline. Please make sure that the ID is unique in the defined search range. Specifying the Git Commit Message \u00b6 transportRequestDocIDFromGit searches for lines that follow a defined pattern in the Git commit messages ( git log ) of your project. Only if necessary, specify the pattern with the label changeDocumentLabel (default= ChangeDocument ). Behind the label, enter a colon, blank spaces, and the identifier. Upload - define the change document ID ChangeDocument: 1000001234 Specifying the Git Commit Range \u00b6 The Git commit messages to be considered are determined by the parameters gitFrom (default= origin/master ) and gitTo (default= HEAD ). The naming follows the Git revision range notation git log <gitFrom>..<gitTo> . All commit messages accessible from gitTo but not from gitFrom are taken into account. Choose the commit range accordingly, as the detection of multiple IDs causes the scan to fail.

It is primarily made for the transport request upload steps to provide the transport request ID by Git means. Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file . In this case, calling the step is essentially reduced to defining the step name. Calling the step can be done either in an orchestrator specific way (e.g. via a Jenkins library step) or on the command line. Jenkins Command Line library ( 'piper-lib-os' ) transportRequestReqIDFromGit script: this piper transportRequestReqIDFromGit Outputs \u00b6 Output type Details commonPipelineEnvironment custom/transportRequestId Executed on Jenkins Master This step is executed on the Jenkins master only. On the master node the project's Git repository is fully available. If kubernetes is used, the Git repository would have to be stashed. Depending on the size of the repository, this would be quite expensive or not possible at all. Administering the Transport Request ID by Git Commit Messages \u00b6 The transport request ID identifies a container in the ABAP development system that can be used to document and transport changes within the landscape. If you upload your pipeline artifacts into such a container, please provide the transport request ID in an upload step. See transportRequestUploadSOLMAN . With transportRequestReqIDFromGit you can retrieve the transport request ID from the commit message of the Git repository of your project. This way, you can address the transport request without having to change the setup of your pipeline. Please make sure that the ID is unique in the defined search range. General Purpose Pipeline Init Stage \u00b6 The step can also be configured via General Purpose Pipeline in Init stage using the config.yml as follows: stages : Init : transportRequestReqIDFromGit : true This will initialize the step within the Init stage of the pipeline and retrieve the transportRequestId from the git commit history. Specifying the Git Commit Message \u00b6 transportRequestReqIDFromGit searches for lines that follow a defined pattern in the Git commit messages ( git log ) of your project. Only if necessary, specify the pattern with the label transportRequestLabel (default= TransportRequest ). Behind the label, enter a colon, blank spaces, and the identifier. Upload - define the transport request ID TransportRequest: ABCD10005E Specifying the Git Commit Range \u00b6 The Git commit messages to be considered are determined by the parameters gitFrom (default= origin/master ) and gitTo (default= HEAD ). The naming follows the Git revision range notation git log <gitFrom>..<gitTo> . All commit messages accessible from gitTo but not from gitFrom are taken into account. Choose the commit range accordingly, as the detection of multiple IDs causes the scan to fail. Keep the default values HEAD and origin/master in case you want to retrieve the ID within the scope of a pull request. The default values should be sufficient provided that you commit the transport request ID into the pull request you do not merge the origin/master before the scan you do not change the transport request ID while developing This way, only the commits ( HEAD ) that have not yet entered the main branch origin/master are scanned. o 3d97415 (origin/master) merged last change | | o d99fbf7 (HEAD) feature fixes | | | o 5c380ea TransportRequest: ABCD10001E | | | o 0e82d9b new feature |/ o 4378bb4 last change If you want to retrieve the ID from the main branch, be aware that former transport request IDs may already be in the history.

Description \u00b6 This step uploads an UI5 application from your project folder to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository of the SAPUI5 ABAP back-end infrastructure using the SAPUI5 Repository OData service. It processes the results of the ui5 build command of the SAPUI5 toolset. Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file . In this case, calling the step is essentially reduced to defining the step name. Calling the step can be done either in an orchestrator specific way (e.g. via a Jenkins library step) or on the command line. Jenkins Command Line library ( 'piper-lib-os' ) transportRequestUploadCTS script: this piper transportRequestUploadCTS Outputs \u00b6 Output type Details commonPipelineEnvironment custom/transportRequestId Prerequisites \u00b6 You have installed the SAP component SAP_UI 7.53 or higher on your ABAP system. You have enabled the OData Service to load data to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository . You have the S_DEVELOP authorization to perform operations in your SAPUI5 ABAP repository. You have created a transport request on the ABAP system, which is the target container of the SAPUI5 application for your upload. Setting Up an Upload Client \u00b6 The step transportRequestUploadCTS uses the Node.js -based SAP Fiori tools to upload your SAPUI5 application to the UI5 repository service of your ABAP back-end infrastructure. It performs the deployment command Fiori deploy on a Docker image. By default, a plain node.js Docker image is pulled and equipped with the SAPUI5 toolset during runtime of the pipeline. Alternatively, you can provide your own, fully equipped Docker image. This speeds up the upload process, but requires you to maintain and provision the image on a Docker registry. Creating a Fully Equipped Docker Image \u00b6 To create an own Docker image with the SAP Fiori tools , proceed as follows: Create a node.js based Docker image with the SAP Fiori tools installed: FROM node USER root RUN npm install -global @ui5/cli @sap/ux-ui5-tooling @ui5/logger @ui5/fs USER node /bin/bash docker build -t my/fiori-node . Push your image to your private Docker Hub registry : /bin/bash docker push my/fiori-node Add the following content to your config.yml file: steps : transportRequestUploadCTS : dockerImage : 'my/fiori-node' deployToolDependencies : [] Building an SAPUI5 Application \u00b6 Build your SAPUI5 application with the build command of the SAPUI5 toolset and use the step npmExecuteScripts to run the build command. Proceed as follows to do so: Configure the steps in the package.json file of your project as follows: { ... \"scripts\" : { \"start\" : \"ui5 serve\" , \"test\" : \"npm run lint\" , \"build\" : \"ui5 build --clean-dest\" , ... }, \"dependencies\" : {}, \"devDependencies\" : { \"@ui5/cli\" : \"^2.11.2\" , ... } } Configure the execution step in the pipeline as follows: stage ( 'Build' ) { npmExecuteScripts ( script: this , runScripts: [ 'build' ]) } Note: Do not use the mtaBuild step. The MTA Build Tool mta is dedicated to the SAP Business Technology Platform. It does neither create the expected dist folder nor the compliant content. Uploading an SAPUI5 Application \u00b6 The Fiori toolset uses the ODATA service to upload your UI5 application to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository. It controls access by Basic Authentication (user/password based authentication). Note: Do not upload your application to SAP Business Technology Platform. The SAP BTP does not support Basic Authentication . Note: Use an HTTPS endpoint to ensure the encryption of your credentials. Specifying the Transport Request \u00b6 The target of the upload is a transport request, identified by an identifier (ID). The step transportRequestUploadCTS allows you to set the ID by parameter. Alternatively, you can pass the ID through the parameter commonPipelineEnvironment . For example, by performing a step that generates the ID or obtains it differently. For more information, see transportRequestReqIDFromGit . Adding a Parameter \u00b6 A parameterized pipeline allows you to specify the ID with the launch of each build instead of entering it statically into the pipeline. transportRequestUploadCTS ( script: this , transportRequestId: $ { TRANSPORT_REQUEST_ID }, ... ) The Jenkins pipeline input step allows you to specify the ID at runtime of the pipeline. def ids = input ( message: \"Upload?\" , parameters: [ string ( name: 'TRANSPORT_REQUEST_ID' , description: 'Transport Request ID' ) ] ) transportRequestUploadCTS ( script: this , transportRequestId: ids [ 'TRANSPORT_REQUEST_ID' ], ... ) Common Pipeline Environment \u00b6 Use the step transportRequestReqIDFromGit to obtain the transportRequestId value from your Git commit messages. This step extracts the ID from the commit messages of your project repository and enters it into the commonPipelineEnvironment . In turn, the upload step transportRequestUploadCTS picks it up from there. transportRequestReqIDFromGit ( script: this ) transportRequestUploadCTS ( script: this , ... ) General Purpose Pipeline Release Stage \u00b6 The step can also be configured via General Purpose Pipeline in Release stage using the config.yml as follows: stages: Release: transportRequestUploadCTS: true This will initialize the step within the Release stage of the pipeline and will upload the desired application (SAPUI5/OPENUI5) to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository.

Transitive dependencies are omitted. The list might be incomplete. Consider using the ppiper/jenkins-master docker image. This images comes with preinstalled plugins.

The properties can also be configured on a per-step basis: [ ... ] steps : transportRequestUploadFile : applicationId : 'FOO' changeManagement : type : 'SOLMAN' endpoint : 'https://example.org/cm' [ ... ] The parameters can also be provided when the step is invoked. For examples see below. CTS Uploads \u00b6 In order to be able to upload the application, it is required to build the application, e.g. via npmExecuteScripts . The content of the app needs to be provided in a folder named dist in the root level of the project. Note: Do not use the mtaBuild step. The MTA Build Tool mta is dedicated to the SAP Business Technology Platform. It does neither create the expected dist folder nor the compliant content. Although the name of the step transportRequestUploadFile might suggest something else, in this case a folder needs to be provided. The application, which is provided in the dist folder is zipped and uploaded by the fiori toolset used for performing the upload. For CTS related uploads we use a node based toolset. When running in a docker environment a standard node image can be used. In this case the required deploy tool dependencies will be installed prior to the deploy. It is also possible to provide a docker image which already contains the required deploy tool dependencies ( config.changeManagement.cts.nodeDocker.image ). In this case an empty list needs to be provided as config.changeManagement.cts.deployToolDependencies . Using an already pre-configured docker image speeds-up the deployment step, but comes with the disadvantage of having to maintain and provision the corresponding docker image. When running in an environment without docker, it is recommanded to install the deploy tools manually on the system and to provide an empty list for the deploy tool dependencies ( config.changeManagement.cts.deployToolDependencies ).

You have a user account on the ABAP system where you have assigned the required roles for uploading via RFC. You have created a transport request on the ABAP system, which is the target container of the upload. RFC Client \u00b6 The RFC Client connects to your ABAP system using the SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK . For more information, see classical SAP connectivity technology RFC . To install an RFC library based Connector Client, proceed as follows: Create a Docker image as described in the Git repository devops-docker-images/node-rfc .

Usage \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file . In this case, calling the step is essentially reduced to defining the step name. Calling the step can be done either in an orchestrator specific way (e.g. via a Jenkins library step) or on the command line.

See SAP Solution Manager Administration . You have a change document to which your transport request is coupled. You have a transport request, which is the target container of the upload. You have installed the Change Management Client with the needed certificates. See Change Management Client . Change Management Client \u00b6 The Change Management Client (CM Client) handles the access to SAP Solution Manager. The CM Client is a software running under Linux, which can initiate basic change management tasks in the Solution Manager. The client is used by default as a Docker image , but can also be installed as a command line tool . Certificates It is expected that the Solution Manager endpoint is secured by SSL and sends a certificate accordingly. The CM Client verifies the certificate. If the publisher of this certificate is unknown, the connection will be rejected. The CM Client uses the underlying JDK procedures for the verification. Accordingly, the issuer must be specified in the truststore of the JDK. Create a clone of the image and add the necessary certificate to its truststore in case you use the Docker image . Extend the truststore of the environment with the necessary certificate in the case you use the immediate command line tool . Specifying the Change Document and Transport Request \u00b6 The target of the upload is a transport request and the associated change document. Both objects are identified by identifiers (ID). transportRequestUploadSOLMAN allows you to set IDs by parameter. Alternatively, you can pass the IDs through the Common Pipeline Environment. For example, by performing a step that generates the IDs or obtains them differently. See transportRequestDocIDFromGit and transportRequestReqIDFromGit By Step Parameter \u00b6 A parameterized pipeline allows to specify the IDs with the launch of the build instead of entering them statically into the pipeline. transportRequestUploadSOLMAN ( script: this , changeDocumentId: $ { CHANGE_DOCUMENT_ID }, transportRequestId: $ { TRANSPORT_REQUEST_ID }, ... ) The Jenkins pipeline input step allows to specify the IDs at runtime of the pipeline. def ids = input ( message: \"Upload?\" , parameters: [ string ( name: 'CHANGE_DOCUMENT_ID' , description: 'Change Document ID' ), string ( name: 'TRANSPORT_REQUEST_ID' , description: 'Transport Request ID' ) ] ) transportRequestUploadSOLMAN ( script: this , changeDocumentId: ids [ 'CHANGE_DOCUMENT_ID' ], transportRequestId: ids [ 'TRANSPORT_REQUEST_ID' ], ... ) Common Pipeline Environment \u00b6 With OS Piper you can use the steps transportRequestDocIDFromGit and transportRequestReqIDFromGit to obtain the changeDocumentId and transportRequestId values from your Git commit messages.

Groovy templating for this parameter is deprecated and no longer supported. Using the runOptions parameter the 'seleniumAddress' for UIVeri5 can be set. The former groovy implementation included a default for seleniumAddress in the runCommand. Since this is not possible with the golang-based implementation, the seleniumAddress has to be added to the runOptions. For jenkins on kubernetes the host is 'localhost', in other environments, e.g. native jenkins installations, the host can be set to 'selenium'. runOptions : [ \"--seleniumAddress=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\" , ..... ] The parameter failOnError is no longer supported on the step due to strategic reasons of pipeline resilience. To achieve the former behaviour with failOnError: false configured, the step can be wrapped using try/catch in your custom pipeline script. The installCommand does not support queueing shell commands using && and | operator any longer. If you see an error like fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /home/jenkins) it is likely that your test description cannot be found. Please make sure to point parameter runOptions to your conf.js file like runOptions: [...., './path/to/my/tests/conf.js'] Examples \u00b6 Passing credentials from Jenkins \u00b6 When running acceptance tests in a real environment, authentication will be enabled in most cases. UIVeri5 includes features to automatically perform the login with credentials in the conf.js . However, having credentials to the acceptance system stored in plain text is not an optimal solution. Therefore, UIVeri5 allows templating to set parameters at runtime, as shown in the following example conf.js : // Read environment variables const defaultParams = { url : process . env . TARGET_SERVER_URL , user : process . env . TEST_USER , pass : process . env . TEST_PASS }; // Resolve path to specs relative to the working directory const path = require ( 'path' ); const specs = path . relative ( process . cwd (), path . join ( __dirname , '*.spec.js' )); // export UIVeri5 config exports . config = { profile : 'integration' , baseUrl : '\\${params.url}' , specs : specs , params : defaultParams , // can be overridden via cli `--params.<key>=<value>` auth : { // set up authorization for CF XSUAA 'sapcloud-form' : { user : '\\${params.user}' , pass : '\\${params.pass}' , userFieldSelector : 'input[id=\"j_username\"]' , passFieldSelector : 'input[id=\"j_password\"]' , logonButtonSelector : 'button[type=\"submit\"]' , redirectUrl : /cp.portal\\/site/ } } }; While default values for baseUrl , user and pass are read from the environment, they can also be overridden when calling the CLI. In a custom Pipeline, this is very simple: Just wrap the call to uiVeri5ExecuteTests in withCredentials : withCredentials ([ usernamePassword ( credentialsId: 'MY_ACCEPTANCE_CREDENTIALS' , passwordVariable: 'password' , usernameVariable: 'username' )]) { uiVeri5ExecuteTests script: this , runOptions: [ \"--baseURL=NEW_BASE_URL\" , \"--params.user=${username}\" , \"--params.pass=${password}\" , \"--seleniumAddress=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\" , \"./uiveri5/conf.js\" ] } Please note: It is not recommended to override any secrets with the runOptions, because they may be seen in the Jenkins pipeline run console output. During the withCredentials call, the credentials are written to the environment and can be accessed by the test code. The following example shows the recommended way to handle the username and password for a uiVeri5ExecuteTests call that needs authentication. The passwordVariable and usernameVariable need to match the environment variables in the test code. withCredentials ([ usernamePassword ( credentialsId: 'MY_ACCEPTANCE_CREDENTIALS' , passwordVariable: 'TEST_PASS' , usernameVariable: 'TEST_USER' )]) { uiVeri5ExecuteTests script: this , runOptions: [ \"--seleniumAddress=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\" , \"./uiveri5/conf.js\" ] } There is also the option to use vault for test credentials . In a Pipeline Template, a Stage Exit can be used to fetch the credentials and store them in the environment. As the environment is passed down to uiVeri5ExecuteTests, the variables will be present there. This is an example for the stage exit .pipeline/extensions/Acceptance.groovy where the credentialsId is read from the config.yml : void call ( Map params ) { // read username and password from the credential store withCredentials ([ usernamePassword ( credentialsId: params . config . acceptanceCredentialsId , passwordVariable: 'password' , usernameVariable: 'username' )]) { // store the result in the environment variables for executeUIVeri5Test withEnv ([ \"TEST_USER=\\${username}\" , \"TEST_PASS=\\${password}\" ]) { //execute original stage as defined in the template params . originalStage () } } } return this","title":"uiVeri5ExecuteTests"},{"location":"steps/uiVeri5ExecuteTests/#uiveri5executetests","text":"Executes UI5 e2e tests using uiVeri5 Deprecation notice Details of changes after the step migrated to a golang based step can be found below .","title":"uiVeri5ExecuteTests"},{"location":"steps/uiVeri5ExecuteTests/#description","text":"In this step the ( UIVeri5 tests ) are executed.","title":"Description"},{"location":"steps/uiVeri5ExecuteTests/#usage","text":"We recommend to define values of step parameters via .pipeline/config.yml file .

Groovy templating for this parameter is deprecated and no longer supported. Using the runOptions parameter the 'seleniumAddress' for UIVeri5 can be set. The former groovy implementation included a default for seleniumAddress in the runCommand. Since this is not possible with the golang-based implementation, the seleniumAddress has to be added to the runOptions. For jenkins on kubernetes the host is 'localhost', in other environments, e.g. native jenkins installations, the host can be set to 'selenium'. runOptions : [ \"--seleniumAddress=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\" , ..... ] The parameter failOnError is no longer supported on the step due to strategic reasons of pipeline resilience. To achieve the former behaviour with failOnError: false configured, the step can be wrapped using try/catch in your custom pipeline script. The installCommand does not support queueing shell commands using && and | operator any longer. If you see an error like fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /home/jenkins) it is likely that your test description cannot be found.

UIVeri5 includes features to automatically perform the login with credentials in the conf.js . However, having credentials to the acceptance system stored in plain text is not an optimal solution. Therefore, UIVeri5 allows templating to set parameters at runtime, as shown in the following example conf.js : // Read environment variables const defaultParams = { url : process . env . TARGET_SERVER_URL , user : process . env . TEST_USER , pass : process . env . TEST_PASS }; // Resolve path to specs relative to the working directory const path = require ( 'path' ); const specs = path . relative ( process . cwd (), path . join ( __dirname , '*.spec.js' )); // export UIVeri5 config exports . config = { profile : 'integration' , baseUrl : '\\${params.url}' , specs : specs , params : defaultParams , // can be overridden via cli `--params.<key>=<value>` auth : { // set up authorization for CF XSUAA 'sapcloud-form' : { user : '\\${params.user}' , pass : '\\${params.pass}' , userFieldSelector : 'input[id=\"j_username\"]' , passFieldSelector : 'input[id=\"j_password\"]' , logonButtonSelector : 'button[type=\"submit\"]' , redirectUrl : /cp.portal\\/site/ } } }; While default values for baseUrl , user and pass are read from the environment, they can also be overridden when calling the CLI. In a custom Pipeline, this is very simple: Just wrap the call to uiVeri5ExecuteTests in withCredentials : withCredentials ([ usernamePassword ( credentialsId: 'MY_ACCEPTANCE_CREDENTIALS' , passwordVariable: 'password' , usernameVariable: 'username' )]) { uiVeri5ExecuteTests script: this , runOptions: [ \"--baseURL=NEW_BASE_URL\" , \"--params.user=${username}\" , \"--params.pass=${password}\" , \"--seleniumAddress=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\" , \"./uiveri5/conf.js\" ] } Please note: It is not recommended to override any secrets with the runOptions, because they may be seen in the Jenkins pipeline run console output. During the withCredentials call, the credentials are written to the environment and can be accessed by the test code. The following example shows the recommended way to handle the username and password for a uiVeri5ExecuteTests call that needs authentication. The passwordVariable and usernameVariable need to match the environment variables in the test code. withCredentials ([ usernamePassword ( credentialsId: 'MY_ACCEPTANCE_CREDENTIALS' , passwordVariable: 'TEST_PASS' , usernameVariable: 'TEST_USER' )]) { uiVeri5ExecuteTests script: this , runOptions: [ \"--seleniumAddress=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\" , \"./uiveri5/conf.js\" ] } There is also the option to use vault for test credentials . In a Pipeline Template, a Stage Exit can be used to fetch the credentials and store them in the environment. As the environment is passed down to uiVeri5ExecuteTests, the variables will be present there. This is an example for the stage exit .pipeline/extensions/Acceptance.groovy where the credentialsId is read from the config.yml : void call ( Map params ) { // read username and password from the credential store withCredentials ([ usernamePassword ( credentialsId: params . config . acceptanceCredentialsId , passwordVariable: 'password' , usernameVariable: 'username' )]) { // store the result in the environment variables for executeUIVeri5Test withEnv ([ \"TEST_USER=\\${username}\" , \"TEST_PASS=\\${password}\" ]) { //execute original stage as defined in the template params . originalStage () } } } return this","title":"Passing credentials from Jenkins"},{"location":"steps/vaultRotateSecretId/","text":"vaultRotateSecretId \u00b6 Rotate Vault AppRole Secret ID Description \u00b6 This step takes the given Vault secret ID and checks whether it needs to be renewed and if so it will update the secret ID in the configured secret store.
