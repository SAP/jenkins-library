## Introduction

This scenario describes how an add-on for the SAP BTP, ABAP environment is built. It is intended for SAP partners who want to provide a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution on the SAP BTP using the ABAP Environment. Therefore, a partner development contract (see [SAP PartnerEdge Test, Demo & Development Price List](https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/assets/partnership/sales/order_license/pl_pl_part_price_list.html)) is required. This page aims to provide an overview of the build process of the add-on.

The development on SAP BTP, ABAP environment systems is done within [“software components”](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/58480f43e0b64de782196922bc5f1ca0.html) (also called: “repositories”). The add-ons being built in this scenario are made up by one or multiple software components combined to an add-on product. The “ABAP environment pipeline” can be used to build and publish the add-on product. Please read on for more details about the Add-on Product and the build process.

Of course, this tackles only the upstream part of the SaaS solution lifecycle. Once the add-on is published, it can be consumed as a [multitenant application in ABAP environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/195031ff8f484b51af16fe392ec2ae6e.html).

A comprehensive guidance on how to develop and operate SaaS applications using add-ons, can be found [here](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/e3c38ebaefc44523b679e7a0c375bc86.html).

## The Add-on Product

The installation and maintenance of ABAP software is done / controlled via add-on product versions. An **add-on product version** is a „bundle" of software component versions made available at the same time for implementing a well-defined scope of functionality. It is the technical / delivery view on a software portfolio.

### Add-on Product Version

An add-on product version is defined by a name and a version string. The name of an add-on product is a string with a maximum of 30 characters and consists of the [namespace](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/84282) and a freely chooseble part - `/NAMESPC/PRODUCTX`. The add-on product name should only include uppercase characters.

The version string consists of three numbers separated by a dot - `1.2.0`. The numbers in the version string have a hierarchic relationship:

- The first number denotes the release. Release deliveries contain the complete scope of functionality. It is possible to change the software component version bundle in a new release.
- The second number denotes the Support Package Stack level. A Support Package stack consists of Support Package deliveries of the contained software component versions. It is not possible to change the software component version bundle in such a delivery.
- The third number denotes the Patch level. A Patch delivery contains Patch deliveries of the contained software component versions.

### Software Component Version

!!! note "Development on SAP BTP, ABAP environment"
    As you may know, the development in the SAP BTP, ABAP environment is done within [software component](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/58480f43e0b64de782196922bc5f1ca0.html). A software component is self-contained, and a reduced set of [objects and features of the ABAP programming language](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/c99ba0d28a1a4747b8f47eda06c6b4f1.html) can be used.
    The software component and development objects must be created in a namespace, so that clashes between software of different vendors and SAP are avoided. Therefore, a namespace must be reserved before the development can start. [SAP note 105132](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/105132) describes the namespace reservation process. The namespace must be reserved for the same customer number under which the “SAP BTP, ABAP ENVIRONMENT” tenants are licensed.

A **software component version** is a technically distinguishable unit of software and is installed and patched as a whole. It consists of ABAP development packages and contained objects. Software component versions are delivered via delivery packages. But software component versions are not individual shipment entities. They can only be delivered to customers as part of an [add-on product version](#add-on-product-version).
A software component version is defined by a name and a version string. The name of a software component is string with a maximum of 30 characters and consists of the [namespace](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/84282) and a freely chooseble part - `/NAMESPC/COMPONENTA`. The version consists of three numbers separated by a dot - 1.2.0. The numbers in the version string have a hierarchic relationship:

- The first number denotes the release. Release deliverie contains the whole software component and deliver planned, new functionalities or feature enhancements. They are delivered with delivery packages of type “Add-on Installation Package”.
- The second number denotes the Support Package level. Support Package deliveries contain a larger collection of corrections and may contain smaller, planned functional enhancements. They are delivered with delivery packages of type “Component Support Package”.
- The third number denotes the Patch level. Patch deliveries shall only contain small, unplanned corrections that are necessary to keep the software up-and-running. They are shipped with delivery packages of type “Correction Package”.

The type of delivery does not need to be chosen manually; it is automatically determined by the delivery tools.

Software Component Versions are uniquely created and independent from the add-on product versions where they are included.
This means that once a software component version was built it will be reused in any following add-on product versions where referenced.

### Target Vector

As explained above, the shipment of a software takes place via add-on product versions. The delivered content of an add-on product version is defined in a target vector, which is used by the deployment tools. The target vector is derived from the addon.yml (more on that below) and contains the following information:

- Product name
- Product release
- Product Support Package stack and Patch level
- A list of contained software component versions with
  - Software component name
  - Software component release
  - Delivery Package, which delivers the versions

In stage *Build* a target vector for the particular add-on product version is published in test scope. This makes it possible to perform a add-on test installation in stage *Integration Tests*. At this point the new add-on product version is not available for add-on updates and can only be installed during system provisioning by providing the `addon_product_version` parameter explicitly.

In stage *Publish* the target vector is then published in production scope, so that the new version will become available for addon update and installation during system provisioning without providing a particular `addon_product_version`.

## Building the Add-on Product

The build process of an add-on product is orchestrated by a Jenkins Pipeline, the “ABAP environment pipeline” provided in this project. To run this pipeline, it only needs to be configured – which will be explained in the sections “Prerequisites” and “Configuration”.

![ABAP Environment Pipeline Build](../images/abapEnvironmentBuildPipeline.png)

The pipeline consists of different steps responsible for a single task. The steps themselves are grouped thematically into different stages. For example, early in the pipeline, the ABAP environment system needs to be created and the communication needs to be set up. This is done in the “Prepare System” stage. You can read more about the different stages in the ABAP environment pipeline [documentation](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/pipelines/abapEnvironment/introduction/).

Different services and systems are required for the add-on build process.

### Delivery Tools

With the following tools the add-on deliveries are created.

#### Assembly System

First the ABAP system responsible for the add-on assembly. All actions related to the ABAP source code are executed on this system, e.g. running checks with the ABAP test cockpit (ATC) or the physical build of the software components. There are two communication scenarios containing the different APIs of the ABAP environment system: [Test Integration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/b04a9ae412894725a2fc539bfb1ca055.html) and [Software Assembly Integration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/b04a9ae412894725a2fc539bfb1ca055.html).
The assembly system should be of [service type abap](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/f0163565eb554f009f990652ca41d1c6.html) and be provisioned with parameter `is_development_allowed = false` to prevent local changes.

#### Add-on Assembly Kit as a Service (=AAKaaS)

The Add-on Assembly Kit as a Service is responsible for registering and publishing the add-on product. On a high level it is a service offered in the SAP Service & Support systems (thus access is granted via Technical Communication User) that, similar to the Software Delivery Assembler (SDA, transaction SSDA) as part of the [SAP Add-On Assembly Kit](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_ADD-ON_ASSEMBLY_KIT/), packs the delivery into an importable package format.

### Deployment Tools

With these SAP tools the assembled add-on deliveries are deployed to ABAP systems, for example into the [installation test system](#installation-test-system).

#### Installation Test System

In order to verify that the delivery packages included in the add-on product version being built are installable, a target vector is published in "test" scope. In the *Integration Tests* stage an ABAP system of service plan `saas_oem` is created. This  makes it possible to install a specific add-on product version into an ABAP system that is provisioned. The installation test system should be be provisioned with the parameter `is_development_allowed = false` to prevent local changes.

### Prerequisites

There are several parts that are required to run the pipeline for building an ABAP Environment Add-on.

#### Jenkins Server

The pipeline responsible for building ABAP add-ons has been created specifically for [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io). Therefore, a Jenkins Server is required. The [piper project](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/guidedtour/) provides a Jenkins image, which already includes the necessary configurations. Of course, it is also possible to [configure an existing server](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/infrastructure/customjenkins/).

#### Git Repository

The pipeline configuration is done in a git repository (for example on GitHub). This repository needs to be accessed by the Jenkins Server. If the repository is password protected, the user and password (or access token) should be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store (Manage Jenkins &rightarrow; Manage Credentials).

#### Add-on Assembly Kit as a Service (=AAKaaS)

The communication with the AAKaaS needs a technical communication user. The creation and activation of such a user is described in [SAP note 2174416](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2174416). Make sure that this technical communication user is assigned to the customer number under which the SAP BTP, ABAP Environment instances are licensed and for which the development namespace was reserved. The user and password need to be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store.

#### Cloud Foundry Access

ABAP environment systems are created in the SAP BTP cockpit. For this pipeline, the creation and deletion of the systems are automated via the Cloud Foundry command line interface: [cf CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/). For this to work, two things need to be configured:

- Cloud Foundry needs to be enabled on subaccount level. This can be done on the Subaccount Overview page. The subaccount is then mapped to a “Cloud Foundry Organization”, for which you must provide a suitable name during the creation. Have a look at the [documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a96b1df8525f41f79484717368e30626/Cloud/en-US/dc18bac42270468d84b6c030a668e003.html) for more details.
- A (technical) user is required to access the SAP BTP via the cf CLI. The user needs to be assigned as space member including [Space Developer](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a96b1df8525f41f79484717368e30626/Cloud/en-US/967fc4e2b1314cf7afc7d7043b53e566.html) role in order to create/read service instances and service keys. The user and password need to be stored in the Jenkins Credentials Store.

Later, during the pipeline configuration, you will specify the Service Plan, which will be used for the creation of an ABAP environment system. Please make sure, that there are enough entitlements for this [Service Plan in the Subaccount](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a96b1df8525f41f79484717368e30626/Cloud/en-US/c40cb18aeaa343389036fdcdd03c41d0.html).

#### Register Add-on Product for a Global Account

The registration of a new add-on product is a manual step. Your add-on product should only be installed in ABAP systems within your global production account. Therefore, the add-on product name and global production account need to be registered with SAP. This process is described in [Build](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/3bf575a3dc5043f895f8bd411d2a86a1.html#loio25049720bde447e395b3df0bc05e5a50) in section *Register add-on product/global production account*.

- As an add-on admin, create an incident using component BC-CP-ABA, and provide the following information:
Add-on product name = `addonProduct` in `addon.yml` file, e.g. /NAMESPACE/NAME

- Global production account ID = *Account ID* in section *Global Account Info* on the overview page of your global account, e.g. `151b5fdc-58c1-4a55-95e1-467df2134c5f` (Feature Set A) or *Global Account Info* on the *Usage Analytics* page of your global account (Feature Set B).

This step can be triggered by you or by SAP partner management (governance process to be negotiated). As a response to the service request, SAP creates a configuration for the requested add-on product so that the add-on product can be installed in the global account.

### Configuration

In the following subsections, the pipeline configuration for this scenario is explained.
Please refer to the [configuration page](../pipelines/abapEnvironment/configuration.md).

#### Add-on descriptor file

The build process is controlled by an add-on descriptor file called `addon.yml`. This file must be created manually and must be stored in the GIT repository of the pipeline. It must contain information about the to-be-delivered [add-on product version](#add-on-product-version) and the contained [software component versions](#software-component-version). Below, you see an example:

```YAML
---
addonProduct: /NAMESPC/PRODUCTX
addonVersion: 1.2.0
repositories:
  - name: /NAMESPC/COMPONENTA
    branch: v1.2.0
    version: 1.2.0
    commitID: 7d4516e9
    languages:
      - DE
      - EN
  - name: /NAMESPC/COMPONENTB
    branch: v2.0.0
    version: 2.0.0
    commitID: 9f102ffb
    languages:
      - DE
      - EN
      - FR
```

Explanation of the keys:

- `addonProduct`: this is the technical name of the add-on product
- `addonVersion`: This is the technical version of the add-on product `<product version>.<support package stack level>.<patch level>`

The section “repositories” contains one or multiple software component versions:

- `name`: the technical name of the software component
- `branch`: this is the branch from the git repository
- `version`: this is the technical software component version `<software component version>.<support package level>.<patch level>`
- `commitID`: this is the commitID from the git repository
- `languages`: specify the languages to be delivered according to ISO-639. For all deliveries of an Add-on Product Version, the languages should not change. If languages should be added, a new Add-on Product Version must be created.

Changing the `addonVersion` string does not necessarily imply that new delivery packages are being created. In case software component versions are used that were already part of a previous add-on `addonVersion`, the existing delivery packages are reused for the new add-on product version.
Only by changing the `version` of a software component, the build of a new delivery package with the latest changes is triggered.

The `addonVersion` should be determined by synchronously to how the software components bundle is changed: In case the release version of a software component is changed, the release of the `addonVersion` should be changed. If the support package version of a software component is changed, support package version of the add-on should be changed. And if patch version of a software component, the patch version of the add-on should be adjusted.

`branch`, `commitID` identify a specific state of a software component. Branches of a software component can include different commits. The `commitID` should only be changed while also adjusting the `version` number of a software component.

The `branch` should only be changed while also changing release version or support package level of a software component. During creation of a patch version (CPK) the `branch` should remain the same as before, so that previous and current commit of the software component can be found in the same branch for comparison.

##### Versioning Rules

For the development and the provisioning of product-/software component versions, it is necessary to ensure, that there are no gaps within the version and level counters. Therefore, only a continuous increase in version numbers is allowed. The following examples show valid and invalid cases, respectively:

Valid increase:

- 1.0.0 to 2.0.0
- 1.1.2 to 2.0.0
- 2.0.0 to 2.0.1
- 2.1.0 to 2.2.0
- 2.1.1 to 2.1.2

Invalid increase:

- 1.0.0 to 3.0.0 (version 2.0.0 is missing; therefore, a product/component version is missing)
- 1.1.2 to 2.1.0 (version 2.0.0 is missing; therefore, a product/component version is missing)
- 2.0.0 to 2.0.2 (version 2.0.1 is missing; therefore, a patch level is missing)
- 2.1.0 to 2.3.0 (version 2.2.0 is missing; therefore, a support package level is missing)
- 2.1.1 to 2.1.3 (version 2.1.2 is missing; therefore, a patch level is missing)

Technically, the allowed number range for add-on product version and software component version is 1.0.0 to 9999.9999.9999.

The support package level of software component version can only go up until 369 because of technical limitations.
For the patch level, there is a technical limit of 36³, limited to 9999.

### Example

Please have a look at the configuration example to [build and publish add-on products using a transient assembly system](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-ci-cd-samples/tree/addon-build).
As an alternative you can refer to the [example using a permanent assembly system](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-ci-cd-samples/tree/addon-build-static).
