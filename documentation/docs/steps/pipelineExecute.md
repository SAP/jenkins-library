# pipelineExecute

## Description
Loads a pipeline from a git repository. The idea is to set up a pipeline job in Jenkins that loads a minimal pipeline, which in turn loads the shared library and then uses this step to load the actual pipeline.

A centrally maintained pipeline script (Jenkinsfile) can be re-used by
several projects using `pipelineExecute` as outlined in the example
below.
