* `script` - The common script environment of the Jenkinsfile running. Typically the reference to the script calling the pipeline step is provided with the `this` parameter, as in `script: this`. This allows the function to access the [`commonPipelineEnvironment`](commonPipelineEnvironment.md) for retrieving, for example, configuration parameters.
* `changeDocumentId` - The id of the change document related to the transport request to release.
* `transportRequestId` - The id of the transport request to release.
* `changeManagement/changeDocumentLabel` - A pattern used for identifying lines holding the change document id.
* `changeManagment/transportRequestLabel` - A pattern used for identifying lines holding the transport request id.
* `changeManagement/credentialsId` - The id of the credentials to connect to the Solution Manager. The credentials needs to be maintained on Jenkins.
* `changeManagement/endpoint` - The address of the Solution Manager.
* `changeManagement/git/from` - The starting point for retrieving the change document id
* `changeManagement/git/to` - The end point for retrieving the change document id
* `changeManagement/git/format` - Specifies what part of the commit is scanned. By default the body of the commit message is scanned.

## Step configuration
The step is configured using a customer configuration file provided as
resource in an custom shared library.

```
@Library('piper-library-os@master') _

// the shared lib containing the additional configuration
// needs to be configured in Jenkins
@Library(foo@master') __

// inside the shared lib denoted by 'foo' the additional configuration file
// needs to be located under 'resources' ('resoures/myConfig.yml')
prepareDefaultValues script: this,
                             customDefaults: 'myConfig.yml'
```

Example content of ```'resources/myConfig.yml'``` in branch ```'master'``` of the repository denoted by
```'foo'```:

```
general:
  changeManagement:
    changeDocumentLabel: 'ChangeDocument\s?:'
    cmClientOpts: '-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<path to truststore>'
    credentialsId: 'CM'
    endpoint: 'https://example.org/cm'
    git:
      from: 'HEAD~1'
      to: 'HEAD'
      format: '%b'
```

The properties configured in section `'general/changeManagement'` are shared between all change managment related steps.

The properties can also be configured on a per-step basis:

```
  [...]
  steps:
    transportRequestRelease:
      changeManagement:
        endpoint: 'https://example.org/cm'
        [...]
```

The parameters can also be provided when the step is invoked. For examples see below.

## Return value
None.

## Exceptions
* `IllegalArgumentException`:
    * If the change id is not provided.
    * If the transport request id is not provided.
* `AbortException`:
    * If the release of the transport request fails.

## Example
```groovy
transportRequestRelease script:this,
                        changeDocumentId: '001',
                        transportRequestId: '001',
                        changeManagement: [
                          endpoint: 'https://example.org/cm'
                        ]
```
