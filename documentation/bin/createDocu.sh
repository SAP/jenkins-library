# --in: is created by the unit tests. It contains a mapping between the test case (name is

# --out: Contains a transformed version. The calls to other pipeline steps are resolved in a
# transitive manner. This allows us to report all Jenkins plugin calls (also the calls which
# are performed by other pipeline steps. E.g.: each step includes basically a call to
# handlePipelineStepErrors. The Plugin calls issues by handlePipelineStepErrors are also
# reported for the step calling that auxiliar step).
