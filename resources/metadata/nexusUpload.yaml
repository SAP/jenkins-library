  description: Upload artifacts to Nexus Repository Manager
  longDescription: |
    Upload build artifacts to a Nexus Repository Manager.

    Supports MTA, npm and (multi-module) Maven projects.
    MTA files will be uploaded to a Maven repository.

    The uploaded file-type depends on your project structure and step configuration.
    To upload Maven projects, you need a pom.xml in the project root and set the mavenRepository option.
    To upload MTA projects, you need a mta.yaml in the project root and set the mavenRepository option.
    To upload npm projects, you need a package.json in the project root and set the npmRepository option.

    If the 'format' option is set, the 'URL' can contain the full path including the repository ID. Providing the 'npmRepository' or the 'mavenRepository' parameter(s) is not necessary.

    npm:
    Publishing npm projects makes use of npm's "publish" command.
    It requires a "package.json" file in the project's root directory which has "version" set and is not delared as "private".
    To find out what will be published, run "npm publish --dry-run" in the project's root folder.
    It will use your gitignore file to exclude the mached files from publishing.
    Note: npm's gitignore parser might yield different results from your git client, to ignore a "foo" directory globally use the glob pattern "**/foo".

    If an image for mavenExecute is configured, and npm packages are to be published, the image must have npm installed.
