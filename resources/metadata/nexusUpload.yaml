  description: Upload artifacts to Nexus Repository Manager
  longDescription: |
    Upload build artifacts to a Nexus Repository Manager.

    Supports MTA, npm and (multi-module) Maven projects.
    MTA files will be uploaded to a Maven repository.

    The uploaded file-type depends on your project structure and step configuration.
    To upload Maven projects, you need a pom.xml in the project root and set the mavenRepository option.
    To upload MTA projects, you need a mta.yaml in the project root and set the mavenRepository option.
    To upload npm projects, you need a package.json in the project root and set the npmRepository option.

    npm:
    Publishing npm projects makes use of npm's "publish" command.
    It requires a "package.json" file in the project's root directory which has "version" set and is not delared as "private".
    To find out what will be published, run "npm publish --dry-run" in the project's root folder.
    It will use your gitignore file to exclude the mached files from publishing.
    Note: npm's gitignore parser might yield different results from your git client, to ignore a "foo" directory globally use the glob pattern "**/foo".

    If an image for mavenExecute is configured, and npm packages are to be published, the image must have npm installed.
