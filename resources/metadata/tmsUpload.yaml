  longDescription: |-
    This step allows you to upload an MTA file (multi-target application archive) and multiple MTA extension descriptors into a TMS (SAP Cloud Transport Management service) landscape for further TMS-controlled distribution through a TMS-configured landscape.

    TMS lets you manage transports between SAP Business Technology Platform accounts in Neo and Cloud Foundry, such as from DEV to TEST and PROD accounts.
    For more information, see [official documentation of SAP Cloud Transport Management service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/TRANSPORT_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE)

    !!! note "Prerequisites"
    * You have subscribed to and set up TMS, as described in [Initial Setup](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/66fd7283c62f48adb23c56fb48c84a60.html), which includes the configuration of a node to be used for uploading an MTA file.
    * A corresponding service key has been created, as described in [Set Up the Environment to Transport Content Archives directly in an Application](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/8d9490792ed14f1bbf8a6ac08a6bca64.html). This service key (JSON) must be stored as a secret text within the Jenkins secure store or provided as value of tmsServiceKey parameter.
