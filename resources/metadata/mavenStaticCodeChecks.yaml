  description: Execute static code checks for Maven based projects. The plugins SpotBugs and PMD are used.
  longDescription: |
    Executes Spotbugs Maven plugin as well as Pmd Maven plugin for static code checks.
    SpotBugs is a program to find bugs in Java programs. It looks for instances of “bug patterns” — code instances that are likely to be errors.
    For more information please visit https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/maven.html
    PMD is a source code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and so forth. It supports Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex and Visualforce, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML, XSL.
    For more information please visit https://pmd.github.io/.
    The plugins should be configured in the respective pom.xml.
    For SpotBugs include- and exclude filters as well as maximum allowed violations are conifgurable via .pipeline/config.yml.
    For PMD the failure priority and the max allowed violations are configurable via .pipeline/config.yml.

Violations at or less than this priority level are considered failures and will fail the build if failOnViolation=true and the count exceeds maxAllowedViolations. The other violations will be regarded as warnings and will be displayed in the build output if verbose=true. Setting a value of 5 will treat all violations as failures, which may cause the build to fail. Setting a value of 1 will treat all violations as warnings. Only values from 1 to 5 are valid.
