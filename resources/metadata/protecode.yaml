    !!! info "New: Using protecodeExecuteScan for Docker images on JaaS"
        **This step now also works on "Jenkins as a Service (JaaS)"!**<br />
        For the JaaS use case where the execution happens in a Kubernetes cluster without access to a Docker daemon [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) is now used silently in the background to save a Docker image retrieved from a registry.


    !!! hint "Auditing findings (Triaging)"
        Triaging is now supported by the Protecode backend and also Piper does consider this information during the analysis of the scan results though product versions are not supported by Protecode. Therefore please make sure that the `fileName` you are providing does either contain a stable version or that it does not contain one at all. By ensuring that you are able to triage CVEs globally on the upload file's name without affecting any other artifacts scanned in the same Protecode group and as such triaged vulnerabilities will be considered during the next scan and will not fail the build anymore.
