    Execute npm run scripts in all package json files, if they implement the scripts.

    ### build with depedencies from a private repository
    if your build has scoped/unscoped dependencies from a private repository you can include a .npmrc into the source code
    repository as below (replace the `@privateScope:registry` value(s) with a valid private repo url) :

    ```
    @privateScope:registry=https://private.repository.com/
    //private.repository.com/:username=${PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_USER}
    //private.repository.com/:_password=${PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_PASSWORD_BASE64}
    //private.repository.com/:always-auth=true
    registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
    ```
    `PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_USER` and `PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_PASSWORD_BASE64` (Base64 encoded password) are the username and password for the private repository
    and are exposed are environment variables that must be present in the environment where the Piper step runs or alternatively can be created using :
