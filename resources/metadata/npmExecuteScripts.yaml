  description: Execute npm run scripts on all npm packages in a project
  longDescription: >
    This step handles JavaScript dependency installation and basic npm commands.
    One of the following lock files must be present, otherwise the step will fail:
    - package-lock.json (uses `npm install`)
    - yarn.lock (uses `yarn install`)
    - pnpm-lock.yaml (uses `pnpm install`)

    Only the install command uses the detected package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm).
    All other commands (e.g., `run`, `pack`, `publish`) are executed via the `npm` CLI, regardless of which lock file is detected.

    Rationale: In the Piper environment, using the npm CLI for non-install commands
    provides sufficient functionality without requiring additional CLI dependencies.
    Supporting yarn or pnpm for these commands was deemed unnecessary due to
    lack of added benefit.

    ### Build with private depedencies from a repository
    if your build has scoped/unscoped dependencies from a private repository you can include a .npmrc into the source code
    repository as below (replace the `@privateScope:registry` value(s) with a valid private repo url) :

    ```
    @privateScope:registry=https://private.repository.com/
    //private.repository.com/:username=${PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_USER}
    //private.repository.com/:_password=${PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_PASSWORD_BASE64}
    //private.repository.com/:always-auth=true
    registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
    ```

    `PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_USER` and `PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_PASSWORD_BASE64` (Base64 encoded password) are the username and password for the private repository
    and are exposed are environment variables that must be present in the environment where the Piper step runs or alternatively can be created using :
