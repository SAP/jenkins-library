  longDescription: |-
    This step executes a codeql scan on the specified project to perform static code analysis and check the source code for security flaws.

    The codeql step triggers a scan locally on your orchestrator (e.g. Jenkins) within a docker container so finally you have to supply a docker image with codeql
    and Java plus Maven.
