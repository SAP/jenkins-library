  description: Runs ABAP unit tests and ATC (ABAP Test Cockpit) checks for a specified object scope.
  longDescription: |
    This step executes ABAP unit test and ATC checks for a specified scope of objects that exist in a local Git repository on an ABAP system.
    Depending on your use case, you can specify a scope of objects for which you want to execute the checks. In addition, you can choose whether you want to execute only ABAP units tests, or only ATC checks, or both.
    By default, both checks are executed.
    The results of the checks are stored in a [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) format. With the help of the Jenkins [Warnings-Next-Generation](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng/) Plugin), you can view the issues found, and navigate to the exact line of the source code where the issue occurred.
    To make the findings visible in Jenkins interface, you will need to use step recordIssues. An example will be shown in the Example section.

    You can use this step as of SAP S/4HANA 2020.
