    ### build with depedencies from a private repository
    if your build has dependencies from a private repository you can include the standard requirements.txt into the source code with `--extra-index-url` as the first line

    ```
    --extra-index-url https://${PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_USERNAME}:${PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_PASSWORD}@<privateRepoUrl>/simple
    ```
    `PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_USERNAME` and `PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_PASSWORD` are the username and password for the private repository
    and are exposed are environment variables that must be present in the environment where the Piper step runs or alternatively can be created using :
    [vault general purpose credentials](../infrastructure/vault.md#using-vault-for-general-purpose-and-test-credentials)
