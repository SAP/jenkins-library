  description: Executes Synopsys Detect scan
  longDescription: |
    This step executes [Synopsys Detect](https://synopsys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INTDOCS/pages/62423113/Synopsys+Detect) scans.
    Synopsys Detect command line utlity can be used to run various scans including BlackDuck and Polaris scans. This step allows users to run BlackDuck scans by default.
    Please configure your BlackDuck server Url using the serverUrl parameter and the API token of your user using the apiToken parameter for this step.

          For example: the version 1.2.3 of the artifact will result in a version 1 to report into, when `versioningModel: major` is used and will result in a version 1.2 when `versioningModel: major-minor` is used.
          Recommendation for a Continuous Delivery process is to use `versioningModel: major`.

          Defines a custom version for the Detect scan which deviates from the typical versioning pattern using [`version`](#version) and [`versioningModel`](#versioningModel).
          It allows to set non-numeric versions as well and supersedes the value of [`version`](#version) which is calculated automatically.
          The parameter is also used by other scan steps (e.g. Fortify, Sonar, WhiteSource) and thus allows a common custom version across scan tools.
