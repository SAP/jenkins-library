    This step will install the maven project into the local maven repository.
    It will also prepare jacoco to record the code coverage and
    supports ci friendly versioning by flattening the pom before installing.

    ### build with dependencies from a private repository

    if your build has dependencies from a private repository you can include a project settings xml into the source code repository as below (replace the `<url>`
    tag with a valid private repo url).
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
      <servers>
        <server>
            <id>private.repo.id</id>
            <username>${env.PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_USERNAME}</username>
            <password>${env.PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_PASSWORD}</password>
        </server>
      </servers>
    </settings>
    ```
    `PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_USERNAME` and `PIPER_VAULTCREDENTIAL_PASSWORD` are the username and password for the private repository and are exposed as environment variables that must be present
    in the environment where the Piper step runs or alternatively can be created using :
    [vault general purpose credentials](../infrastructure/vault.md#using-vault-for-general-purpose-and-test-credentials)

    include the below `<repositories>` tag in your `pom.xml` to reference the `<server>` and make sure the values in the `<id>` tags match
    ```xml
    <repositories>
        <repository>
          <id>private.repo.id</id>
          <url>https://private.repo.com/</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    ```

    Ensure the following configuration in the Piper `config.yaml` to ensure the above settings xml is included and all steps can consume this parameter:

    ```yaml
    general:
      projectSettingsFile: <path to the above settings.xml>
    ```
