          This can be used to set variables like it is provided by 'cf push --var key=value'.
          The order of the maps of variables given in the list is relevant in case there are conflicting
          variable names and value between maps contained within the list. In case of conflicts, the last
          specified map in the list will win. Though each map entry in the list can contain more than one
          key-value pair for variable substitution, it is recommended to stick to one entry per map,
          and rather declare more maps within the list. The reason is that if a map in the list contains
          more than one key-value entry, and the entries are conflicting, the conflict resolution behavior
          is undefined (since map entries have no sequence).
          Note: variables defined via 'manifestVariables' always win over conflicting variables defined
          via any file given by 'manifestVariablesFiles' - no matter what is declared before.
          This is the same behavior as can be observed when using 'cf push --var' in combination
