    This step allows you to upload an MTA file (multi-target application archive) and multiple MTA extension descriptors into a TMS (SAP Cloud Transport Management service) landscape for further TMS-controlled distribution through a TMS-configured landscape.

    TMS lets you manage transports between SAP Business Technology Platform accounts in Neo and Cloud Foundry, such as from DEV to TEST and PROD accounts.
    For more information, see [official documentation of SAP Cloud Transport Management service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/TRANSPORT_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE)
