  description: This step determines the ABAP delivery packages (name and type), which are needed to deliver Software Component Versions.
  longDescription: |
    This step takes the list of Software Component Versions from the addonDescriptor in the commonPipelineEnvironment and determines the ABAP delivery packages.
    If a package does not exist yet in the package registry, it is created there. The response contains detail information for this package and a package status, which determines the next actions:
    "P": Package was created in the registry; production can be started / continued
    "R": Package exists and is already released; production is not needed and will be skipped
    The steps waits until the status "P" or "R" is achieved.
    The name, type and namespace of each package is written back to the addonDescriptor in the commonPipelineEnvironment.
