  description: Black Duck Binary Analysis (BDBA), previously known as Protecode is an Open Source Vulnerability Scanner that is capable of scanning binaries. It can be used to scan docker images but is supports many other programming languages especially those of the C family.
  longDescription: |-
    Black Duck Binary Analysis (previously known as Protecode) is an Open Source Vulnerability Scan tool which provides the composition of Open Source components in a product along with Security information (no license info is provided).
    BDBA (Protecode) uses a combination of static binary analysis techniques to X-ray the provided software package to identify third-party software components and their exact versions with a high level of confidence. Methods range from simple string matching to proprietary patent-pending techniques.

    !!! hint "Auditing findings (Triaging)"
        Triaging is now supported by the BDBA (Protecode) backend and also Piper does consider this information during the analysis of the scan results though product versions are not supported by BDBA (Protecode). Therefore please make sure that the `fileName` you are providing does either contain a stable version or that it does not contain one at all. By ensuring that you are able to triage CVEs globally on the upload file's name without affecting any other artifacts scanned in the same BDBA (Protecode) group and as such triaged vulnerabilities will be considered during the next scan and will not fail the build anymore.

        longDescription: |-
          Defines a custom version for the BDBA scan which deviates from the typical versioning pattern using [`version`](#version) and [`versioningModel`](#versioningmodel).
          It allows to set non-numeric versions as well and supersedes the value of [`version`](#version) which is calculated automatically.
          The parameter is also used by other scan steps (e.g. Fortify, Sonar, WhiteSource) and thus allows a common custom version across scan tools.

          The versioning model used for result reporting (based on the artifact version).
          For example: the version 1.2.3 of the artifact will result in a version 1 to report into, when `versioningModel: major` is used and will result in a version 1.2 when `versioningModel: major-minor` is used.
          Recommendation for a Continuous Delivery process is to use `versioningModel: major`.
