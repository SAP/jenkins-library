  description: Executes end-to-end tests using npm
  longDescription: |
    This step executes end-to-end tests in a Docker environment using npm.

    The step spins up a Docker container based on the specified `dockerImage` and executes the `installScript` and `runScript` from `package.json`.

    The application URLs and credentials can be specified in `appUrls` and `credentialsId` respectively. If `wdi5` is set to `true`, the step uses `wdi5_username` and `wdi5_password` for authentication.

    The tests can be restricted to run only on the productive branch by setting `onlyRunInProductiveBranch` to `true`.
